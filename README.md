# Project - Guess Who?

The project was to create an own digital version of the classic board game "Guess who", using JavaScript. 

## The working progress

For this project, I had to study a lot about JavaScript. I looked at videos, read articles and looked on forums - but what helped me the most was to discuss the coding with my teammates. Helping each other out was truly the key to make the site work!
This project was a good start on my journey to learn JavaScript, I'm happy about the result and that I also had time to do a little styling. If I had more time, I would've added a counter of the number of guesses.
