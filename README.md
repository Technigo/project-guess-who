# Project Guess Who

My task was to build a digital version of the classic board game Guess Who, in order to practice creating objects and arrays in JavaScript, and connecting these to the dom.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

### If more time

- Improve filter alerts, i.e. customise them better and not have the exact option values being displayed in them
- Confetti upon win!
- Add new categories for clothes, hairstyles och facial expressions etc
- Replace the cards with something cute like Pokemons or cats and then also re-doing the categories and filters from scratch to better fit the new characters (and improve my JavaScript skills, of course)

### Technologies used:

- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

- [Prettier](https://www.prettier.io/) for code linting
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for deployment
