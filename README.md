# Guess who!

This week we dug deeper into JavaScript: objects, arrays and functions by creating a "Guess who"-game.

## The problem

My main issue this week was that one of the categories in my game was a boolean (the category "other" could only be beard och no beard) and i wasn't sure how to filter out the characters based on a boolean value. But after som help from Stack, asking ChatGTP for examples and poking around the code I eventually figured it out!

JavaScript is still quite confusing but i feel like im getting a better hang of it every week!
