# Project Name

This weekâ€™s project is to create a your own digital version of the classic board game Guess Who.

## The problem

I followed the steps closely and tried to keep the code as short and clean as possible. I have tried to understand the steps, which I still struggle with. 

I had to redo the fork-clone process due to trouble with the terminal and changes that I couldn't merge between browser and local changes. I made a new clone and pasted in my code, therefore I have only one commit for the actual project steps.
