# Project Name

The assigment was to create a guess-who game where the user plays the game against the computer. 

The code is mostly done in Javascript using arrays, functions and methods. When the board loads the computer chooses a charachter to be the secret one. The user then gets to choose between diffrent options to narrow down the characters. Finally the user gets to guess on a character and is told if it was the right or wrong guess.

## The problem

My biggest problem was to understand how to use the methods with the given array. I used Technigos material, google and chatGPT to understand. I also got a lot of help from my teammates. 

If I had more time I would try to make the code a bit cleaner by goind through it and se if some lines are possible to "put togehter"

I would also have added the option for the user to put in their name and have it displyed somewhere in the board.
