# Project Name

The aim of the project was to create a guess who game

**🔵 Blue Level (Minimum Requirements)**

- The board with characters should be generated when the website is loaded.
- A randomly selected person should be set as the secret when the game starts.
- You should be able to select questions to ask about the people and filter the board based on those questions.
- You should also give the player feedback with alerts
- You should be able to guess the secret person and get an answer if it's correct or not.

**🔴 Red Level (Intermediary Goals)**

- Check the bonus step
- Change the array of objects:
  - Add more information about the people, and with this add the possibility to ask questions and filter the board in regards to these addons.
  - Change the characters' info to be about your family, football club, colleagues, or cute dogs.
- Create a counter to keep track of how many guesses a player does.
- Change the styling to be as you want it!

**⚫ Black Level (Advanced Goals)**

- Create a timer that measures how long time each game takes.
- Add sound effects and/or animations when flipping a card or winning the game.
- Create the possibility to add a player name when starting the game.

## The problem

I laid out what needed to happen for the game to work, then focused on JavaScript. Once I got all of my functions to work, I changed the theme of the game, styled it and added additional features such as alerts and a timer.
