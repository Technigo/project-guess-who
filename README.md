# Project Name

Replace this readme with your own information about your project.

Make the Guess Who-game work.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

I did a lot of reading beforehand, too much it turned out because I would have less time in the end than I planned for to work on the project, so I pretty much only had time to make the game function. Technologies? Lots of googling.
