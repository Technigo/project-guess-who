# Project Name

The Assignment is to build a guesswho game! its a game with cards with diffrent portraits of people, the computer chooses 1 secretperson from the cards. The user should then ask questions selected from a dropdownlist to filter the people and then finally guess on who the secret person is.

## The problem

I had filtering issues and used ai to get some tips on how I could debug using the console, I narrowed the issues down bit by bit and used stackoverflow as source to fix issues.

I also added an extra feature such as shuffle the board when a new game starts.
