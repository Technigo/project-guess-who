# Project Name

This week's project (2nd week with Javascript) was to create the classic game "Guess who". We got some code to start with and had to work throught the functions to generate the board and make the game work. We practiced functions, objects and arrays and to connect this to the DOM.

## The problem

At first I had to put quite a lot of time to just understand what code that had been given to us and also how to get started. I tried to focus on each and every step, provided in the assignment, and tried different code. I got some help from looking at earlier projects in Github, when I got stuck in connecting the functions to each other. My plan was to create my own board but in the end, when I got the game to work, I decided to stick with the board given to us and put some more time just trying to understand the code and what I had done.
