# Project Name

This week was all about creating the game guess who. we got some pre made code that we took over and it was our job to make the code work again and add things to the javascript

## The problem

I asked for help alot in differnt mediums like github, slack and discord. we programmed together and tried our best to understand this weeks code.

My repo just dissapeard so all my git commits just dissapeard. so I wish I could create them again showing what I pushed before

I would also like to invoke a happening when the countdown stops making it impossible to answer when its done.
