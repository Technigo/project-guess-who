Create your own digital version of the classic board game Guess Who using JavaScript.

How did you plan?
I dedicated the beginning of the week to study all the materials, going over it 1-2 times and end of the week to write the actual code.

What technologies did you use?
Slack, Stack Overflow, Youtube, Jitsi with team-mates

If you had more time, what would be next?
Add more properties to the different characters and sound effects.
