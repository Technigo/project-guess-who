# Project Guess Who

Replace this readme with your own information about your project.

Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.

My task was to build a digital version of the classic board game Guess Who, in order to practice creating objects and arrays in JavaScript, and connecting these to the dom.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

### If more time

- Improve filter alerts, i.e. customise them better and not have the exact option values being displayed in them
- Confetti upon win!
- Add new categories for clothes, hairstyles och facial expressions etc
- Replace the character cards with my own that I would have created in [an old school drag-and-drop dollmaker](https://dollzmania.neocities.org/), and also re-do the categories from scratch. And if I would've taken the time to do all that, I think it would be a crime not to style the whole page look like an old GeoCities site...

### Technologies used:

- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

- [Prettier](https://www.prettier.io/) for code linting
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for deployment
