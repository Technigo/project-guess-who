# Project Name

Guess Who- game. It was really interesting, fun but mostly difficult to do this project. But I tried to follow all the steps that was given to us which was a great way to learn.

Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.

## The problem
I struggled a lot hence second time with Java script, but I asked for help in our channels and googled and watched videos a lot.
