# Project Guess Who

We created our own version of the classic game "Guess Who". I chose a minion & Gru theme.
The focus features where to randomly select a secret character/minion and that the user could chose different options to narrow the number of choices to chose from.

## The problem

I added additional options to the selector and updated the board with new characters. Job effort mainly in JS and some in CSS and HTML.
If I had more time I would have added a counter for the number of guesses that the user used and I would have also made the mobile version have better responsiveness.
