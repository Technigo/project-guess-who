# Guess Who

I made a Guess Who game which allows players to ask questions to try and guess a secret person. The secret person is filtered down based on whether the player correctly guesses a feature of the secret person or not. Each time a guess is made, only the remaining possible suspects are left on the board. The player can guess any time who the secret person might be. 

## The problem

I approached the problem by thinking about the different functions needed for the game to work, and using Javascript to create the functions and actions to move the game forward. I also used some HTML to create a guess counter, and styled the game with CSS. If I had more time I would add sound effects and a timer to the game.
