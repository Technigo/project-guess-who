Guess who-game. 
Created a digital verison of the board game Guess who. One character gets randomly selected and the player should figure out who that character is by asking questions about his looks
or accesoriess. 

## The problem

I struggled a bit with reaching local variables that got stored in a global. In this case the category from currentQuestion. 
I also sometimes have some issue to start, I kind of know what and how I want to code but just get stuck in the start. 

I just asked around in our team and on stackoverflow to get some inspiration then rewrothe it to suit my idea. 
Can´t really say that I should do anything special next time, it´s more about practise JS.
