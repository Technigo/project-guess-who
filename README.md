# Project Name

The project is to create my own digital version of the classic board game Guess Who! You play the game by asking questions to find out if the 'secret person' has certain characteristics. If you're feeling bold you can take a guess anytime during the game. But don't forget, you only get one guess! The project's focus was to practice creating objects and arrays with JavaScript.

## The problem

 Since we had some starter code to work with, I started by reading it carefully for a better understanding. When I felt that I understood the JavaScript code, I added what was needed to generate the board, select the questions, and so on. When the minimal requirements were met, I customised it with new customised alert and some styling. 
 
 If I had more time, I would try using Sweet Alert.
