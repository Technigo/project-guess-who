# Project Name

This project is part of the Technigo bootcamp autumn 2021, the goal was to learn javascript and particularly array and object manipulation. "Guess Who" is the classic game re-imagined in a web environment.

## The problem

The template from Technigo was a styled site that showed the side bar with question dropdown and an empty game board to the right, the generateBoard function that puts all the characters on the board was pre built. The objectiv vas to hook up the prebuilt functions with correct en eventlisteners and create a filter function that could sort the array of characters according to the question input from the user. The element to select question is auto generated from the characters array. A counter counts the number of guesses, on restart the counter resets.

The site is build with HTML, CSS, JS. The left side has a sidebar with the title and questions and buttons, the right part is the game area where all photos of the characters are placed.
