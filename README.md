# Guess who!

This weeks project was making the game "Guess who?" 

Having gone a bit overboard with last weeks project i decided just do the minimum requirements for this one, so it's not super ambitious. But basically i followed the steps and got it to work without any bells and whistles. I had some problems with working out how to construct the guess-object for it to work in the different scenarios. I think i understand JS objects pretty well, which i suppose is the purpose of the exercise, but the difficulties were rather in understanding the proposed solution and the game logic. So maybe for me it would have been a better idea to try coming up with my own solution for the guess object and how it is matched with the secret. 

Had i had more time (and perhaps motivation) i would have liked to change the input from drop-down to some kind of buttons, i would also have liked to redo the styling a little bit. Maybe add some kittens even.
