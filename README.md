# Guess Who game project

This weeks project was to create a Guess Who game by using Javascript, and foremost arrays and objects.

## The problem

I had trouble understanding how to start the project at first. The steps in the brief were helpful, but I still felt confused. It helped a bit when I saw how my team-mates hade done it in their projects. I coded along with the lesson on wednesday, and that helped a lot! But later on I started to get confused again, mainly because I swithed focus between the pre-written code, the lessons and the steps. Once again I got great help from my team-mates to solve it. The rest I managed to figure out by looking up info on Stack Overflow and other sites, and one time I looked up someone else project on GitHub to see how they solved the problem. It turned out that I was mostly on the correct path, and that most of my errors were typos or that I forgot to put an alert() in the correct place and such. If I had more time I would love to add an counter and a timer, and to show the result on the win-or-lose-page. I would also like to style it a bit more, and it would be fun to add my own family instead. Also sometimes the code doesn't work the way we were shown, and I would like to have time to figure out why. But the code is working now as it is, and I'm satisfied with that.
