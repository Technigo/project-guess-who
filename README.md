# Project Guess Who

The aim for this project was to create a webpage where you can play the boardgame Guess Who digitally. The main focus was to practice javascript by creating objects, arrays and connect this with the DOM.

## The problem

I used google, stackOverflow and my teammates to solve my problems. The live sessions where really useful as well. The biggest problem I faced was how to target the value inside an array inside another array and get it to be true/false as a boolean value. But thanks to stackOverflow I managed to solve it and this experience will be useful for future projects. 

If I had more time i would like to add more functions, like animation effects or sound effects when pressing buttons for example.
