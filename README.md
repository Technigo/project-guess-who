# Project Name

The task was to create a version of the game Guess Who. Compared to other projects we were given quite a lot of code, and it was a different chellenge trying to understand the existing code to be able to continue it.

## The problem

Most people have different ways of coding, so it was a challenge to understand this way completely. It was important to be able to continue coding the same way.
