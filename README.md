# Project Guess Who

This week's assignment was to create a digital version of the classic board game Guess Who.

## The problem

Most of the CSS and HTML code was already set up for us when we started working with this project, so we could focus more on the JavaScript part which included creating objects and using array methods like filter() and include(), among other things.

If I had more time, I would add some more sound effects, for example when the player wins or loses. I would also try to make the "Time played" show hours, minutes and seconds instead of just seconds.
