# Guess Who Game
### Week 2 Technigo
This project is to generate a Guess who game using the template of HTML/CSS and JS already given to us by technigo.


## The problem
This weeks project we used arrays and objects and tried to become more familiar with array methods such as ```for each``` and ```filter``` 
<br>
<br>
My plan was first to read the others code to see how they designed thier project and they to attempt the same methods for my code. I also realized that I needed to slow down and try to analyze each piece I added to the JS or HTML so I do not get hung up on tiny mistakes. In other words add tiny bits make sure they work and then move on to the next step. 

If I had more time I would style the game to make it more interactive and fun maybe with animations.
