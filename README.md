# Project Name

This is a version of Guess Who game. The user must identify a person based on three guesses. Then the user must make a choice. We are using javascript conditionals , arrys and objects. 


## The problem

The problem was about using arrys and objects. Solving it with discussion with other developers, looking for awnsers on stack overflow and google and folowing the 6 step plan that were helpings me. After that we were adding more styling.
