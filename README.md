# Project: Guess Who?!

For week two of the Technigo bootcamp (week two of the JavaScript sprint) our assignment was to create a version of the classic board game Guess who?. 

## The problem

We were given an array of "character" objects. At game start a random character is generated and the player has a number of guesses to figure out who the seret character is. I've used the array filter method together with if/else statements to update the characters possible to guess on. Using method setInverval method I've created a timer that keeps track of the time spent playing the game.
