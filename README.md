# Project Name

The aim of the project was to create a Guess Who game using javascript arrays and objects, and their methods to manipulate the code. 

## The problem

I started by going through the starter code and understanding what every part of it did. The methods I didn't understand, e.g. filter(), I spent some time looking into on w3schools and stack overflow.
I then followed the step by step instructions for the project and listed in which order best to complete all the different functions. I also played a similar game online to get a feel for how exactly the game should function. 

If I had more time I would've attempted to add a timer and some sound effects for when the player wins the game.
