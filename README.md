# Project Name
The assignment was to supply the provided code files (to a game called "Guess Who?") with the code needed in order to make it playable. For the intermediate and advanced level you could also change the styling and add some extra elements.

## The problem
I started off by looking through the code to fill out the places I had a good idea about how. After that I started working from the top down to get the functions working one by one using console.log() to make sure it was working. Once getting stuck at the same place for an amount of time I asked for guidance to solve it. When the game was functional I added some styling, a hover animation for the cards, a nicer looking alert function (Sweet Alert), a question counter and extra attribute options to the select (shirt, beard, jewellery, pet, jacket, sunglasses).

Looking back I feel good about the process I had. My challenge usually is that I can get stuck for too long with something because I would love to solve it myself but I felt I had a good balance between that and asking for help in this project. Looking at my code I feel proud to have found some ways to make it a bit more efficient, for example by creating a variable for the text in the dropdown in order to only have four instead of six or eight different responses to the user in the filterCharacters function. 

If I would have had more time I would have liked to add a timer and the possibility to add a player name.
