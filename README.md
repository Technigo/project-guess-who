# Project Name
This is a game site which has a function to filter out an array of cards when different questions were triggered. It contains arrays, nested functions and eventListers.

## The problem
This was definitely the most difficult projects by far, because this week we learned not only difining and calling the function but to make it in a multi-layer. To understand the difference and roles of inner function and outer function- and how do I differentiate parameters and name was quite tricky. But I have managed to ask a lot of questions to StackOverFlow, and reading through CSS-Tricks pages for better understanding in Closures and Scopes helped me a lot.
