# Project Name

This project is part of week 3 in the Technigo boot camp and the main goal was to learn more about objects, arrays and loops. The project is built as a Guess Who game where the user is to guess on which character the computer has chosen. Based on visual characteristics the characters are filterd out, giving the user a chance to guess on the most likely character.

## The problem

All the names and characteristics for the characters are stored in objects, in an array, and with a forEach loop the charachter information is set to each card. With an if/else statement the characters are compared to the secret person, and with a filter method the ones that don't match the secret characters are removed. If I would have had more time I would have played aroun even more with the CSS, practicing those skills. I would also add a counter, checking how long it takes for the user to guess.
