# Project Name

The assigmen was to create a Guess Who Game. I decied to make it a children game about animals. 

## The problem

I used other people codes as inspiration , google and slack for asking questions. My plan changed, first I tried to make the game about new characters but whej that didn't work because it was too confusing I first made it with the information provided and once I got it to work changed the characters and design (lesson learned!) If I had more time I would like to try the timer or counter.
