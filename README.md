# Project Guess Who
The assignment was to create the Javascript necessary to run a Guess Who-game. The user was supposed to select questions to ask about the characters and based on the result of the questions characters should be removed. 

## The problem

I worked together with teammates for this project. We read trough the instructions of the code and follow the steps in the instructions. We discussed the code together and it proved really helpful to understand the code and its functions, methods and variables. When we got stuck we had a look at other students code and discussed their solutions and what approach we should use.

We divided the task up into smaller portions and worked trough them one at a time. We used the instructions as a guide. When we finished with the code we went trough the code together and wrote comments and discussed the code together. 

Some of the techniques and methods we used were used arrays, array methods, functions, variables, eventlisteners, DOM selectors and conditional statements.
