The aim of this project was to create a guess who game while focusing on objects, how to use and manipulate objects in JS using arrays and loops. Every object (charchter in the game) has attributes unique to their appearance and a loop was created to filter through each object, scanning for values set by a filter. I only managed to somewhat finish the project with the help of other students work. The Js functions and eventlistners work but the secret character is never revealed.
