# Project Name

This project is to generate a Guess who game using the HTML/CSS and JS already given to us by technigo. 

## The problem
My plan is to look at others code to see how they approached the problems and try to use the same methods as they did. I also used the approach to slow down and try to analyze each piece I added to the JS or HTML so I do not get hung up on tiny mistakes. 
If I had more time I would style the game to make it more interactive and fun maybe with sounds or animations.
