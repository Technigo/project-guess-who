# 'Guess who?' Game
A simple, mildly entertaining 'guess who?' - game with a start/ welcome screen, game and winning/loosing screen and also a restart-button and play again button included! 

## The aim of the game
The aim of the project was to create a guess who game while focusing on objects. How to use objects in JS and how to manipulate them using arrays and loops. Every object has attributes unique to their appearance and a loop was created to filter through each object, scanning for values set by a filter. If they were matched with the filter, or not, they were sorted out. Leaving a few or one at the end to guess on. The game was playtestet throughout. 

### Next time
A goal would have been to add sound to the winning/loosing screen but this time it didn't work. Also figure out how to style the alerts nicer.
