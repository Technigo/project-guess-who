# Project Name

The project is about creating a Guess Who game by using objects, arrays and methos in JavaScript.

## The problem

<<<<<<< HEAD
1. I could not generate the board when the page loaded. I added generateBoard() at the end of the codes and that makes the problem so when I add a console.log then I undrestand that it should work somewhere else in my code. So I add it under const start instead.
2. I could not win the game at the end because all the characters disappeared so I checked the StackOverFlow and found out that I need to add square bracket around the category in const checkQuestion:  if (value === secret[category])
3. The style of the winORLose did not work in css in order to add or delete their display after Guess button. In StackOverFlow found that I can add style i JS instead: winOrLose.style.display = 'flex'
board.style.display = 'none'
4. After Live sessions find out that it is the best if I always use console.log in order to find the problems in console when I see that the game does not work even if I thought I follow the instructions and steps.
