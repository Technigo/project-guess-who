# Guess who

This project was to create a "Guess who"-game. It inluded using the DOM, eventlisteners etc. 

## The problem

It was alot of information to start with in the files already, which both made it easier and trickier. Less to do and figure out along the way, but a lot of code to understand at once in the beginning. 
If I hade more time, I would probably work more on the styling, and additional strechgoals.
