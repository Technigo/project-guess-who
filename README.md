# MC - Guess Who?

This project was about making a game of Guess Who?. The board with characters should be generated when the website is loaded, and it should be possible to restart the game or play again after the game has ended. 
When the game starts, aandomly selected person should be set as the secret person.

The player should be able to select questions (set options) to ask about the people on the cards, and filter the board based on those questions. The player should receive feedback on whether the option selected was wrong or right, and the player should be able to guess on a person they think is correct.

## The problem

What I found difficult this week was understanding the code that was already there (even though there was a video). I understood what the code was, but not always where I should add to it and how. 

The biggest error I encoutered was that when I selected the correct eye color or hair color, I first got the message that it was the right option, then a new alert showed up saying it was a wrong option, and then all the cards disappeared. It was an easy fix -  just curly brackets. However, I was trying to find the error in the wrong places.

It was not as easy to console.log this time - I was not able to find the best places to place the console.log because all the code depended on each other.

With more time, I would do the stretch goals and change the design.

I still feel like I do not always understand why different codes are used - but some of the logic I do understand.

Trouble with the VScode shell - had to get help from Diego, therefore have not been able to push the project while working on it.
