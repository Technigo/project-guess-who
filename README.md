# Project Name - Guess who?

In this week's project you'll create your own digital version of the old character guessing board game Guess Who?

## The problem

The approach was slow but steady, tried to take in as much as possible of provided material and made a handdrawn sketch of the flow before attempting it in code. I follewed the step by step guide and made my way through the solutions/problems. The game did'n feel complete without the play again functionalty so added that as one of the bonus steps.

I find myself always wanting an perhaps needing more time. all and all, I'm happy that my game is working. If I have had more time I would have put it into styling and extra effects for more fun
