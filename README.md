# Project Name

Replace this readme with your own information about your project.

Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.
This assignment was set out to let me practice and use arrays, loops and objects. Through the classic game of Guess Who I have been able to code a functioning game.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

I started this project by doing a lot of preperation work, reading up on arrays, loops and objects and really trying exercises to more quickly grasp the possibilities.
