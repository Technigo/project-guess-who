# Guess who

This is a project where we were creating the javascript-part of the game Guess who.

The game "cards" were creating by an array of objects, one was randomly selected as "secret". With the help of a dropdown menu the user asks about the secret characters attributes. The characters with this attribute were filtered out or kept. Until the user guesses on a person.

## The problem

We were given a step by step approach to the problem. I followed the instructions and used console.log a lot to make sure the right values were compared and the right parameters were sent to the right functions.
I read some material on W3-school to find certain array-functions.
If I had more time I would personalise the game to include friends & family. I would also play around with the styling. Also I would add a tick to the attributes that had already been asked, so you didn't ask the same question multiple times.
