## Build the game: Guess Who?

This project was created during the Technigo bootcamp autumn 2021. The assignment was to create my own digital version of the classic board game Guess Who, in order to practice creating JavaScript objects and arrays and also to connect this to the DOM.

## The problem

The challenge this week was to complete the starter project provided by Technigo and to make a functional game, focusing on the JavaScript part. 

Being a completely newbie to all things JavaScript, this was enough of a challenge for me and I focused all my efforts to follow the instructions provided, repeating the course material over and over again and trying to understand the code I was writing for this project.

The help and support from my fellow team mates in the Elephant team were of major importance this week, and the key for my success with completing the project. 

If I had more time, I would have liked to work more on the HTML and CSS and make the board game about my favorite LEGOÂ® characters.
