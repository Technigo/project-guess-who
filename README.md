Creating a guess who game for practicing objects, arrays and array-methods.

**General Requirements**

- If selected; demo your solution for your team.
- Code follows Technigoâ€™s code guidelines.
- Publish your site on Netlify.

**ðŸ”µ  Blue Level (Minimum Requirements)**

- The board with characters should be generated when the website is loaded.
- A randomly selected person should be set as the secret when the game starts.
- You should be able to select questions to ask about the people and filter the board based on those questions.
- You should also give the player feedback with alerts
- You should be able to guess the secret person and get an answer if it's correct or not.


## The problem

My process looks as follows:
- Figma to design the project.
- I took photos of my kids lego figures.
- Step by step I added functions and eventlisteners to make the logic of the game.

I used methods as filter(), includes() and object destructuring. 

If I had more time I would like to add:
- A function that flipps the cards and just donÂ´t take them away from the board.
- Customized alerts. 
- A high score function using LocalStorage.
