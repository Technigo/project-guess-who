# Guess Who Game

This project involves creating a web-based version of the classic board game "Guess Who." In this game, players must guess a secret character by asking yes or no questions about the character's appearance and features.

## The Problem

I approached the problem by creating a web application that simulates the gameplay of "Guess Who." I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the user interface and implement the game logic.

**Tools and Techniques:**

- **HTML and CSS**: I structured the web page using HTML and styled it with CSS to make it visually appealing and user-friendly.

- **JavaScript**: I used JavaScript to create the game logic, including randomly selecting a secret character, filtering characters based on questions, and handling user interactions.

- **Audio**: I added background music to enhance the gaming experience.

- **Deployment**: The project is deployed on a web server, making it accessible online.

**Planning:**

- I started by designing the layout of the game, including the game board and user interface elements.

- I implemented the game logic step by step, starting with selecting a secret character, filtering characters based on questions, and handling guesses.

- I added audio elements to make the game more engaging and fun.

**Next Steps:**

If I had more time to work on this project, I would consider the following improvements:

- Adding more characters and questions to make the game more challenging and interesting.

- Implementing a scoring system to track the player's performance.

- Enhancing the user interface with animations and visual effects.
