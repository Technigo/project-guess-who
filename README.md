# Project Name: Guess Who

The project was to creat the game Guess Who. We used JavaScript: objects, arrays, diffrent functions such as forEach() and filter().

## The problem

I used my team alot to discus and solv diffrent part of the code. It was alot of preritten code and it took some time to un derstand where to start.

If I had more time I would style the game.
