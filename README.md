# Project Name

This week's project was to create a classic board game Guess Who with JS objects and arrays.

I started the project by going through the existing code to see how the code was structured in relation to how the game is played. Then I worked through the functions to gradually make them work. I create and manipulate objects and arrays, used array methods such as forEach() and filter() and connected these to the DOM. 

 
## The problem

At first it was difficult to understand the given code what was to be done. I had to read the instructions and steps, and look at the code several times before I could start. Since I had similar problems as my classmates I got a lot of help by reading and following  questions and answers on Stackoverflow.
