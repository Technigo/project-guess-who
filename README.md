# Project "Guess Who?"
This is a project that was made during the Technigo Bootcamp spring 2021. It is a digital version of the classic board game where you guess on a secret character.

## The problem
The game is built with Javascript. I started out by reading up on the techniques I needed to use, for example filtering method which was new to me at this point. Then I started to set up the functionality in the order that the original game progresses:
1. Setting a secret person
2. Comparing the users selection with the secret person
3. Applying filter method on the game board according to step 2
4. Display win/lose 

The methods used are filtering, eventlisteners and if/else statements. 
When I had all the functionality in place I also added some of my own styling. It was a really fun project and I am happy with the end result.

If I had more time I would work with refactoring the code (make it shorter) so it is a more efficient use of lines. I would also like to add a couple of functionalities, such as a timer that measures the length of each game, and maybe add more characters! 

I have one error message in the console which I was not able to solve.
