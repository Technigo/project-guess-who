# Guess Who Game

This is a project assigned through the Technigo bootcamp. It's a computer game version of the game Guess Who programmed using HTML, CSS and Javascript. The board and a secret person is generated at the start of the game. The user picks a question via a dropdown menu and the people are filtered out of the board based off of the quesions asked. The user can guess who at any time using a button and a section displays as either they are correct and win or the guess is wrong and they lose. 

## The problem

I used the DOM selectors to access the html elements and manipulate them using javascript. Arrays and objects are used to store values and the functions are working together, step by step to create and manipulate the different variables.  My heavily leaned upon hero of this code is the console.log method which helped me to know who the secret person is in the console whenever i was debugging.  The filter method was used to filter out the people stored in an array.  If-else statements were used to differentiate between different variable circumstances. If i had more time i would add audio and a counter to the amount of guesses and include the count number in the final section for example, "Congratulations, after 3 tries you won!".
