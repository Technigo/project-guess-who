# Pokémon Guess Who

This repository contains a web-based game called Pokémon Guess Who, where players try to guess the hidden Pokémon character by asking questions based on characteristics like color, type, and other attributes. 

## The Problem

The main tools and techniques used in this project include:

- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for building the user interface and game logic.
- DOM manipulation to update the game board and display messages.
- Random selection of the secret Pokémon character at the start of the game.
- Filtering of Pokémon characters based on player questions.
- A counter to keep track of the number of guesses made by the player.

## Future Improvements

If more time were available, the following enhancements could be made to the game:

1. **Difficulty Levels:** Enhance gameplay with multiple difficulty levels. Each level will feature a different number of Pokémon characters on the board, making the game more challenging as players progress.

2. **Immersive Audio:** Elevate the gaming experience with sound effects for actions like correct guesses, wrong guesses, and question selection. 

3. **Personalized Start Page:** Implement a start screen where players can select a trainer/avatar and add their name. 

4. **Diverse Questions:** Expand the range of question categories and attributes, offering players a broader variety of gameplay. 

5. **Interactive Chatbot:** Improve the user interface by replacing alert messages with an interactive chatbot on the side of the screen. The chatbot will engage players, provide feedback, and display choices and progress in a user-friendly manner.

6. **Time Challenge:** Add a timer to track how quickly players guess the hidden Pokémon character. The timer creates an element of time pressure and competition, encouraging strategic decision-making.

7. **High Score System:** Implement a high-score system that records the number of guesses made and the time taken to guess the correct Pokémon character.
