<strong>Guess who game ðŸ¤ 	ðŸ¤¡</strong>

The goal for this project was to start getting more comfortable with Javascript by manipulating arrays, objects and DOM elements as well as understanding the logic of the game and the steps that we needed to follow in order to make it work. 

## The problem

I apporached the problem by carefully reading the instructions and trying many times to find the correct solution in each case. I also used pen and paper to completely wrap my head around the concepts that we were supposed to digest and asked many questions on the live sessions to be completely sure about the sintaxis of the elements that were already in the code when I started.it wasn't an easy process and my work is a result of imitating the steps that I saw in the examples, but now I feel more confident about the code flow and the correct way to approach this kind of problem. if I had more time (and experience on how to do it) I would like to change the cards to use other characters and add sound effects and score board.
