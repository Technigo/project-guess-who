# Guess Who game with Javascript

The second week of the bootcamp, our task was to create a Guess Who game using vanilla Javascript, HTML and CSS. We worked individually.

## The brief

This week’s project is to create your own digital version of the classic board game Guess Who. You'll practice creating objects and arrays and also connect this to the DOM. Here’s an example you can look at: https://technigo-guess-who.netlify.app/

**What you need to do**

✓ Style your page.

✓ Use CSS Grid and Flexbox to layout the page.

✓ Create a responsive design with the following views; Desktop 4 columns, tablet 2 columns, mobile 1 column.

✓ The site should have a header, a main news article, a grid of news articles.

✓ Play around with hover effects, i.e. change colors, add or remove borders or flip the image upside down.
