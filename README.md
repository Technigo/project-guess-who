# Project Name

The purpose of this project was to create a Guess Who? game. The computer selects a character from the board, then the user needs to guess which character is it. The user can start guessing based on preselected questions that will keep filtering the characters on the board. At every step of selecting a characteristic the user will get an answer from the computer based on if it matches with the secret character's characterstics or not.

## The problem

Technigo has already provided the CSS and some JS functions that needed to be completed and envoked. Firs I started with understand how the game works and what functions are already available for use. Then I have started working on the basic functionality to make the game work. Once it was already working I have changed the style and theme and added some extra features to count guesses and set a timer.
This project mainly focused on using loops, forEach, array.filter method and passing arguments into functions.
