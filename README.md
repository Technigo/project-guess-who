# Guess Who

This was the project for week 2 of the Technigo boot camp.

The goal was to make a Guess Who?-type of game. It went well!

## The problem

Adding the basic functionality was fine. The example code was clearly commented and I had no trouble getting the basic functionality up. I started adding some custom elements of my own which gave me a little trouble. The most problematic was the function which removed a guess from the select element of guesses but I managed to get it working in the end.

I also did not really spend any time styling it or modifying the characters or guesses as I focused on the Javascript.
