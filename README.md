# Project Name

This is a project for the week 2 of the Technigo Bootcamp. The digital version of the classic board game Guess Who. 

## The problem
The main challenge was to understand creating objects and arrays using Java Script. 

I played around with HTML and CSS to make my project more unique.

I swapped the font. I download a new font from  <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Handlee">Google fonts </a>. The new selected font is called 'Handlee'. 

Colour palette was also changed. 
The website <a href="https://coolors.co/palettes/popular/3%20colors">Coolors </a> helped me to select the right 3 Colour Palette. 

I used marquee tag which enables a scrolling text area that moves across the page - it was used for a footer and credits information.

The magnifying glass icon was downloaded from a website offering royalty-free images, called <a href="https://www.freepik.com/free-icon/blackhat_14502801.htm#query=detective%20icon&position=34&from_view=search&track=ais">Freepik </a>.

A modest hover effect was used on the picture to add a little bit more of motion and interaction on the website.
