# Project Name

This week's project was to create a classic board game Guess Who with JS objects and arrays, connecting this to the DOM.

## The problem

I started of by trying to understan the code that was given, goint trough all the functions that where already there, connected to the html and css. 
After this i went to the project breif on the notion site and read through all the steps in the hints guide. At first it did not make that mush sense to me. 
The code that we where given - on paper i could understand what was the outcome of the functions and the array of objects but as soon as i was to start it was like a wall hitting my face. I think what i would have liked to do different is to really read through the steps with the hints over and over again. I struggle with my own patience sometimes and just want to "get going". But i really need to hold myself back before i start next time. 

After a little while i was able to invoke the start funcion with the board function and secret persons funcion as well. Since many of my classmates had the same issue as me i got a lot of help seing their problems and the support they got made me realize what i also needed to do. 

I went through the hints steps set up all my event listeners and after a while it kind of just floated on. 
Also i think everything got a bit easier with Maks last session for the array filter and how to access the different values and categories and then i could apply this on my own project. I even got alot of help from other team mates (not from my own group) who i had meetings with to just go through the steps. 

If i would have had more time i think i would have focused more on slowing down the start process. Understanding the game logic (which for this week i think was tough) and focus on knowing my next step before being to eager to start.
