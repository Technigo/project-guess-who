# Project Name

This week project was to recreate the classic board game Guess Who.

## The problem

The game is built using Vanilla Javascript. All the characters of the game are stored in 
an array as objects and different arrays methods are used inside various functions 
to loop through the initial array in order to eliminate the characters that don't match
the value from the checkQuestion function.
