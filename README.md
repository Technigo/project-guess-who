# Guess Who Game - In Progress

This is a web-based implementation of the classic Guess Who board game, where the player has to guess a secret person from a board with different characters. 
The project was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and includes the following features:

The board with characters is generated dynamically when the website is loaded.
A randomly selected person is set as the secret when the game starts.
You can select questions to ask about the people and filter the board based on those questions, by clicking on the corresponding buttons.
The player receives feedback with alerts, indicating whether the current selection of people matches the secret person, or if the game is over (i.e. the secret person was found or all the options were eliminated).
You can guess the secret person at any time, by clicking on the "Guess" button and entering the corresponding name in the input field. The game will display a message indicating whether the guess was correct or not, and if the game is over.

## How to Play
To start the game, simply open the index.html file in your browser. The game will display a board with 24 different characters, along with a set of buttons to select questions about the people (e.g. "Does the person have glasses?", "Is the person smiling?", etc.).

You can click on any of the buttons to filter the board based on that question, and the game will display a feedback message indicating how many people match the criteria. You can continue asking questions and eliminating people until you think you have found the secret person.

To guess the secret person, click on the "Guess" button and enter the name of the person you think is the secret. The game will display a message indicating whether your guess was correct or not, and if the game is over.

If you want to start a new game, click the Restart button and a new secret person will be selected randomly.
