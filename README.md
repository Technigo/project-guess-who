## Project Guess who

Our task was to create a guess who game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

**Requirements**

✓ Generate a board with characters.
✓ A randomly selected person should be set as the secret when the game starts.
✓ Select questions to ask about the people and filter the board based on those questions.
✓ Give the player feedback with alerts
✓ Be able to guess the secret person and get an answer if it's correct or not.

## The problem

DI followed the instructions from the Technigo course to break down the problem. I got familiar with the code and used the tutorials, stack overflow and lessions Technigo provides. 
If I had time I would have spent more time on css and trying out different ways of solving the problems.

- HTML
- CSS
