# GUESS WHO

A guess who game developed by html, css and java script. Using filter function to compare if the selected character has the same attributes as the secret character in order to make the best guess.


## The problem

I thought I could have less struggle compare to the last project, but I found it very hard. I realised I still have some confusion about arrow function and how to passing functions as arguments. 
Also I spent a lot of time to understand the provided code. However I did realise I have improved a lot in terms of spotting my own issue.
By using a lot more console.log did help me to avoid a lot of mistakes, since I tried to make sure the variables work first before I move on and write more.
