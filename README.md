# Project: Guess Who? week2

This week we are building a classic "Guess Who" game and digging deaper into JavaScript 
with objects, arrays and functions. This weeks project was really difficult.

Some of the learnings:

- How to plan and think about game logic
- Create and manipulate loops, objects and arrays.
- Array methods such as `forEach()` and `filter()`
- Use built in functions, map and math.random etc.
- the differents between "including value" and "value"
- More about manipulating the DOM using Javascript
- How to structure your code in functions


## The problem

I know of the game, we have it at home and play alot, that was the easy part. I started whit the pre written code, trying to find out what was missing, what the different steps should be and goggled (W3 and MDN), with "trial and error" found a way forward to a solution. I have struggled with the filter functions and arrays. 

I have figured out how to read already written code and understand what it does and how it "works" but I still realy struggel with starting from "scratch" and writing my own code. So I need to figuer out how to get this 
2 things together. It's also a bit hard to write in prewritten code whith "fill in the blanks", but realy good practis and I trust in the process =)

If I hade more time I would try to "shorten" the code and figure out which parts coulde be in the same function.
I would also worke more on the css counter/time and sound.
