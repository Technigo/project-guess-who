# Technigo Sprint1_week2 Project Guess Who

## The problem
This week I had very limited time working on the project due to heavy workload at work. 

I spent a lot of time understanding the lectures and understand the logic workflow from the original file, which, thankfully is very clearly described, and easy to follow. 

However, I still have 1 problem that is yet to be solved - findOutBtn.addEventListener ("click", checkQuestion), it doesn't return the outcome predicted which would be the alert under filterCharacters showing. 

## Learing 
Plan worklife + codelife better from week 3
