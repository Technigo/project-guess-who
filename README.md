# Build the game: Guess Who?

The focus of this week's assignment is about practising JavaScript.
Create and manipulate objects and arrays. Use different array methods. How to structure the code in functions and plan the game logic.
To start with, we got a HTML, CSS and JS file provided by Technigo.

## The problem

The first thing I did was to deep dive into the code that we received from Technigo. To really understand what they have started with.
Then there were some guidance and suggestion how to approach the project with 6 different steps and one Bonus step.
I followed the guidance. When the basic logic of the game was working as it should, I continued on with the styling. Added a loading gif and played the game from the user perspective. I noticed some features were not so user friendly, so did try to make some small improvements.
Added sound effects when flipping the cards and when player win or lose.
Even though I find the sound effect when flipping the cards a bit annoying, it was a good practise.
I googled a lot about the different array methods and how to use them. Got a few bugs, but could receive help from previously questions on Stack Overflow.
If I had more time, I would make the page more like my own. Maybe replace all the images and attributes to something else. Or maybe instead of filter out the characters by code, I would try to make the user to filter the cards by clicking the ones they want to keep or remove.
