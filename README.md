# Guess Who

The goal for this project was to start getting comfortable with Js using Arrays, Objects and DOM Elements.

## The problem

I had problems making the if/ else if statements to work for the filterCharacters() because the characters didn't dissapear when they have to do it. But then, I realized that I needed to add one more parameters inside of local scope called currentQuestion. In this case, the parameter was named 'attribute' which maps to the properties of the hair and eyes.
