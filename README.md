# Project Name

The assignment was to create a game where a player choses different attributes for a person to narrow down a playing field till only one remains. The player should receive feedback on their guesses and the board should filer away incorrect people. 

## The problem

I approached the problem by thoroughly reading the code-files we were given. They were pretty clear in how the problem should be approached step by step. It was still hard to think of the solutions myself so I used my team, github and coder friends to ask around how I should begin. When the general goals of each step were established it was easier to begin finding functions and methods I could use. 

If I had more time (and felt more confident) I would have worked on styling and teh additional levels. For this week though I am happy to leave it with just a better understanding of javascript (and also how it interacts with HTML).
