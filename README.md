# Project Name

The purpose of this task was creating a Guess Who game. 

The main task was to generate a board of characters, randomly select a secret character and through a series of questions try to guess the secret character 

## The problem

The task was approached through using several JavaScript methods of working with objects and arrays.
  a) forEach method created a board of characters from an array of objects.
  b) With logical operators, event listeners and Array.filter method the characters were filtered depending on whether they had properties of the secret object.
  c) alert() and confirm() methods helped and informed the player through the game
