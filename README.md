# Project Name

Guess who game

the assignment was to use javaScript to make the game guess who work

## The problem
Im having dificulties to grasp on how to start my projects, when I see the code I understand what it does but having a hard time to grasp hot to get there so that was my main problem.
If I had more time I would start over again and plan it differently and I would also use different pictures that I didnt want to know because of the copyrights.
