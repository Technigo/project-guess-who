# Project Name

A game board where you try to find out who the secret character is. You may guess on different attributes to get closer to who it is before your final guess.

## The problem

The main issue was to get the functions to work in order, and to properly filter out characters. The values had to be passed along in order for the different statements to make sense and return proper answers to the player.

With more time I would've exchanged the default players to something a little bit more fun, like movie characters, dog breeds or why not countries or cities?
