# Project Name

This project is a digital version of the old character guessing board game 'Guess Who?'. 
The aim in this project was to learn creating and manipulating objects and arrays, using array methods such as forEach() and filter(), manipulating the DOM using Javascript, structuring the code in functions and plan and think about game logic.

## The problem

The problem was to understand the whole flow of the code, because part of the structure was already pre-written. So the solution was to understand every function separately and understand how they were connected to each other.
