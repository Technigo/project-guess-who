# Project Name

This week's project was to code the game "Guess who?". We were given a lot of code, help and suggestions on how to tackle this assignment. 

## The problem

I followed the instructions that was given to us. I tried to be as organized as possible, following the steps from 1-6. I just focused on the JavaScript for this project. If I had more time I would've added some nice features such as sound, asking for the users name, a counter for the guesses. Also I would have spent some time in the beginning to really create a unique game with a special theme.
