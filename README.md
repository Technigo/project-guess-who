# Project Name
The task was to make a digital version of the classical kids game called Guess who?. 

## The problem
I watched the links and videos provided for this project first, to be able to understand the concept of what I needed to do. In the beginning I found it very confusing and didn't know where to start due to the code that were provided from the start. But I followed the instructions closely, and took small steps every day. I think that was the key for me to be able to start, following the instructions and breaking the project down to small steps.
For this project I relyed on the study material from Technigo, chatGPT, classmates repos at Github and talking to classmates on slack. 
If I had more time, I'd definetely make the game about people I know, instead of the provided cartoons! I'd also like to add sound effects, and some nicer looking popups. It'd also be very cool (but way out of my knowledge) to have animated images that kind of response to events that's happening on the screen!
