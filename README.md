# Qui est-ce? (Guess who game)

This project is all about building a digital version of the classic board game [Guess Who](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guess_Who%3F) using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

Concepts like DOM manipulation, event handling, function definitions, conditional statements, delayed execution, variable assignment, object and array manipulation are applied.

- when selecting "brown hair" found at option [0], no change event is detected by the eventlistener -skipping the whole <selectQuestion> function, not passing the values <category> and <value> in <checkQuestion> (undefined) -<findOutbutton> does not react.
Also, an action on the board game predetermined by the option selected in the menu is activated only when the <findOutbutton> is clicked, and not the <change> event itself, thus making the eventlisterner <change> irrelevant if the <selectQuestion> is invoked directly in next <checkQuestion> function triggered by <findOutbutton> + erasing <questions.addEventListener('change', selectQuestion)>
- 2nd way to bypass the bug is to invoke the selectQuestion function using a second pathway by including it in the start function.

- Error msg in dev tools: 
```
Uncaught (in promise) DOMException: play() failed because the user didn't interact with the document first. https://goo.gl/xX8pDD
``` 
regarding autoplay policy in Chrome I do not master yet.  The 3rd sound file <shuffle.wav> works but with this error message.

- when adding possibility to display a player's name on the <aside>, had to delay the prompt using <setTimeout(addUserName, 1000)> when restarting in start as the prompt appeared immediately after 'click' event on <playAgainButton> before the <start> function is triggered (why?)
