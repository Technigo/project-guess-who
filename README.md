# Project Name
The assigment of week 5 of the technigo bootcamp was to create a Guess Who-game with JavaScript. HTML, CSS and some JavaScript was provided from start.

## Retro
This was the first week of the bootcamp where the main focus was on JavaScript. I am very proud of the final product. The parts that I am most proud over are the possibility to choose from two different themes, and the effects of the themes, and that the options-menu used to ask different questions is created dynamically after theme. My main struggles was grasping how objects works, and how to nest objects/arrays. The styling was not my main focus, and if I would have had more time, I would have changed to images of the Star Wars theme among other details.
