# Project Name

This weeks assignment was to create a "guess who" board. The user should be able to guess on a category and the board should filter out all the characters that does not match the secret person.

## The problem

I had a lot of problems with how to write the code and where to begin. I used my team and other teams to help point me in the right direction. I also had to google a lot. I also got help from Jessi in my team to create an icon for my page.
