# Project "Guess Who?"-game

This week we were to make an online game with the classic Guess Who? where you ask questions and try to guess who the secret person is.

## The problem

To do this I approached the problem by going through all reading material on the different javascript arrays/objects/methods/functions to use and tried
to understand. We did the team tasks together in a small group and asked the rest of the team for help when we got stuck.
When I got stuck on the project I looked in StackOverflow to see if any others had the same issue and that helped a lot. I also googled a lot and discussed with my other teammates. 
The main issue I had was to make the filtering work properly and that took some time to solve.

If I had more time I would style the site a bit more.
