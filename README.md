# Guess who? by Anna Thunberg

A browser version of the classic Guess who-boardgame.

## The problem

I followed the steps closely and tried to keep the code as short and clean as possible. I needed help for most of the steps, and my teammates were invaluable to me. I have worked together with others during the whole project and tried to understand the steps, which I still struggle with. 

I had to redo the fork-clone process due to trouble with the terminal and changes that I couldn't merge between browser and local changes. I made a new clone and pasted in my code, therefore I have only one commit for the actual project steps.
