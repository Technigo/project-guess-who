# project-guess-who

The project is about building a digital version of the classic board game Guess Who using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## The problem

There was a lot of information to this project, and it was hard not to get confused. Generating the board and setting ut the 'secret' persen went fairly easily.

I struggeled a bit from step 3 and forward. There was a lot of tips how to move forward, some strategically placed clues, but just grasping it all and how to start was really difficult. I used console.log a lot to try to understand if my code was working or not as I went forward. There was too much logic/code missing during the project s√• console-logging was the only way to see if the code worked.

At first, just knowing in what order to do things, made me dizzy. Being such a noob makes it quite challenging to grasp the layout and in which order things need to happend.

The project has made me more comfirtable with the DOM, so that's great.

Ther's quite a long if statement that looked hard at once, but then it went better further down I got. This should be made shorter and so it's easier to maintain, but at the moment it's devided into the different categories so it works.

# Requirements for this project:

- The board with characters should be generated when the website is loaded.
- A randomly selected person should be set as the secret when the game starts.
- You should be able to select questions to ask about the people and filter the board based on those questions.
- You should also give the player feedback with alerts
- You should be able to guess the secret person and get an answer if it's correct or not.

I have completed all these steps.

# Stretch goals

Intermediate
*The Bonus step felt easy enough to attack, but it still took some thinking to get it right.
*Changed the styling a bit just for fun.

Advanced stretch goals
\*Sound. I haven't added sound to any of my projects before so I wanted to try it at this one. And it worked!

and what tools and techniques you used to solve it.What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?
