# Project Name

The assignment was to build the JS for a "Guess Who"-game.
## The problem

I had a few problems. The main thing was lack of time. I wish I'd had more time to play around with the code and add further features for the sake of learning but also too add styling for the sake of keeping those skills trimmed.

Besides that I think my biggest issue is that I understand each individual theoretical aspect but putting them together into code and understanding the flow.
I've realised that i's good to start with understanding which parameter and variable is what and name them myself to organise the code a bit better in my head.
That's why in the filter I removed the variables and added parameters instead to clean the code up a bit but also to better understand what does what.

If I had more time I would have liked to, besides the above mentioned styling, add a counter, an input of the players name, more attributes in the characters object and so on.
