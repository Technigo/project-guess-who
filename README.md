Create a Guess Who-game using Javascript

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

I started by looking at this weeks material and do exercises to get a better understanding about objects and arrays. I then looked at the starter code to figure out whats already there and what to add. To get a better understanding I looked at previous student's Github-projects and also the live version of the game from Technigo. Found some answers on Stack Overflow and from my classmates. I've used Javascript (especially functions, objects and arrays). If I had more time I would have personalized the game, changed the board and styled it more in my liking.
