# Project Name
Creating a guess who game with restart, win or lose -functions. Learning how to work with arrays, .map and .filter functions.

## The problem
Since I already had most of the HTML, array and css I went straight into the script. Solving piece by piece until I had the game functioning. 

If I had more time I would stylies it more and add a scoreboard (if I knew how).
