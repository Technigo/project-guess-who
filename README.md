# Project Name
Guess Who Game

I created a Guess Who game for the 2nd week of sprint 1 project.

## The problem

I definitely had a lot of troubles with this project. I found myself feeling too overwhelmed. I googled a lot and on the 3rd day, I decided to ask friends if they want to study together. So we did study together and solved problems together as well. I used Stack Overflow and Google a lot to solve the problems. If I had more time, I would spend more time on styling and do more fun stuff.
