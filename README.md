# Project Name

This project is an online version of the board game "Guess who?". 


## The problem

When I got stuck in this project I tried re-reading the instructions and the comments and discussed my thoughts with others in my team and in the class.

I had planned to continue on with: 
- adjusting the reload game code and not use the function location.reload
- Create a counter for how many questions the user asks
- Updating the styling, moving things around a bit and so on
- Create a timer that clocks each game
- Add sound effects and fireworks animations when the user wins
- Implement a prompt to get the users name at the beginning of the game 

Unfortunately I did not have the time to do this but I will continue with the project and add this on in the coming weeks.
