# Project Name

Project for making a Guess Who game learning about creating and manipulating objects and arrays. Using methods forEach() and filter() and manipulating the DOM with JS.

## The problem

I approached the problem by watching lessons and some googling. Did the Iterations 1-6 to get some guidance, didn't really plan that much since a lot was set up already.
A lot of conditionals used for arrays and objects. Did a counter for number of guesses. Changed some appearance on characters and added some more attributes. And some win/lose sound.

If I had more time I would've liked to add a timer and personalize the board with something else.
