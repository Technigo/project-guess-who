## The problem

I still feel like I just start to get the things we're doing at the end of the week, when it's time to look to next week - and I don't feel like I have "harnessed" the power of the previous lessons - meaning I don't feel like I know what to do.

That being said, this week was more fluent once I stopped thinking I needed to do things a certain way. I think assuming everyone sits down and just writes code that works, as Mozart by the piano, is maybe true for some, but I've let go of the idea that that should be me at this stage (maybe in the future, but no rush)

There was a lot of information that I felt was good but also sometimes not very clear, meaning I felt I got more confused by the instructions than if they hadn't been there. Maybe if I had time to go back, they would make more sense.

ChatGPT has been a great support in finding small typos and faults that I haven't caught but also to give a general overview of my code. My team has been great and supportive as always.
