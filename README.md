# Project Name
Project 'Guess Who' - a project that was made during the Technigo Bootcamp spring 2021. It is based on the classic board game.

## The problem
I started by reading up on the techniques I needed to use, for example filtering method. Technigo provided a sort of step by step structure to start the project so I followed that, and then I worked with the functions in the same order as the game goes. 

If I had more time I would work with 'drying' the code and making it more efficient. I would also add my own styling.
