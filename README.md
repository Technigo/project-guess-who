## The problem

I read through the material, watched the videos and started the project. I followed step by step the instructions and I have trouble connecting the functions with each other. I used ChatCGT, I talked to my team and tried to understand how did they solve the problems and I google a lot. At the end I finally made it work but the board was showned as a column, I tried a few steps I inspected the page and found out where the problem was, I tried a solution and it worked!
