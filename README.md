# Project Name
Week 5 Guess who 
Built a digital version of the classic board game Guess Who. 

## The problem
I followed the steps and tried to figure out how it works.
I struggled a lot with javascript but thanks to my team i could finish my project. 
If i had more time i would add sound effect, counter and change the cards.
