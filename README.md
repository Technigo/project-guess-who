# Project Name

This is the Technigo's boot camp project for week 5. The project was to create a digital version of the classic board name called Guess Who. I built Guess who game Friends edition. 



## The problem

The characters are made by creating objects and giving them the following properties: name, hair and eyes color (as strings), and arrays for dates and family (if they have dated or are relatives of any 6 main characters. Secret person is set by using random tool (charactersInPlay[Math.floor(Math.random() * charactersInPlay.length)]). I have function where I used if / else if / if statements to compared if the secret person has the guess property. I also used if / else if / if statements to show win / lose text if the guess was right or wrong. I also added some audio files for winning and losing, timer and posibility to write player's name.
