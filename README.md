# Project Guess-who 

This project was about making a classical guess who game where a secret person is put by the computer and then the user starts guessing who it could be by asking the computer different statements to screen possible people to find the secret one. The focus of the project was to practice js and specifically objects, arrays and loops.

## The problem

With the help from my team, the material of the week, chat gpt and google I was able to solve the project. My techniques was to break it down into the steps and try some code, see if it worked, changed it if it did not work and so on. If I had more time I would deep dive into the stretch goals.
