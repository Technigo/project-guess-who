# Guess Who | Game

In this project I'm building a digital version of the classic board game "Guess Who" using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?
