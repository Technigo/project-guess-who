# Project Name

This weekâ€™s project was to create oue own digital version of the classic board game Guess Who. Task was to practice creating objects and arrays and also connect this to the DOM. 

## The problem

I had trouble figuring out the filtering function and how to refactor it properly. I took help from my team mates and we figured it out together. I also had trouble with my inner.HTML text not working and by searching on Stackoverflow it turned out that it was the " document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {} " that made the 'onclick' to not work. I do not understand why and did not have time to find the answer so decided to remove the event listener this time.
