# Project Name

Bulding the game Guess Who? using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## The problem

I approached the project step by step, slowly and surely working my way through each step. A lot of research and problem solving and in the end I managed to accomplish what I did with the help of my team, as we really worked together and spent this week helping each other out.

If I had more time I would have changed more of the styling, added a timer, counter and sound effects. But I am happy with what I have and proud I was able to accomplish it.
