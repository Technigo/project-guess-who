# Project Name

The assignment was to create a "Guess Who" game. It should be able to filter and redraw the board with the remaining characters according to the question parameters.

## The problem

The project had steps that were quite clear to follow. I had some difficulties understanding where different functions should go, but with the live sessions and the help of my team (go lions!) I was able to fix some issues and get the game to work. I am super proud of the code itself, even though I had help in some parts, I fully understand every function and variable and this is the most important for me. If I had more time, I would try different approaches to some of the problems and functions I had.
