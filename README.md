# GUESS WHO
This is a browser version of the classic boardgame Guess Who. The objective is to guess the identity of a secret character (out of 24) that the computer opponent has randomly selected. Learning topics included using objects and arrays (& array methods) in JS and getting more comfortable with manipulating the DOM.

## THE PROBLEM
My main objectives were to decipher the pre-existing JS code in the starter files and fill in the missing pieces with my own code. I got it all to work in the end by looking at similar projects. I don't feel like I actually scripted this game by myself; it would be more accurate to say that I spent 2 days learning how to make it work and why it works the way it does. One helpful strategy I employed was to add a console.log notification for every function so I could see when it's invoked. This helped me not only troubleshoot problems I was having, but also better understand the code.

The project uses JS to provide the functionality/interactivity as well as portions of the HTML. Besides looking up relevant resources on Google, I also looked at several similar projects on GitHub to get a better understanding of how everything fits together. I also tested using GitHub Desktop for this project.

If I'd had more time, I would have converted the game into a 'guess which animal' variation.
