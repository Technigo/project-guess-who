# Project Name

This weeks project was to create a Guess Who game by using Javascript, and foremost arrays and objects.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

I had trouble understanding how to start the project at first. The steps in the brief were helpful, but I still felt confused. It helped a bit when I saw how my team-mates hade done it in their projects. I coded along with the lesson on wednesday, and that helped a lot! But later on I started to get confused again, mainly because I swithed focus between the pre-written code, the lessons and the steps. Once again I got great help from my team-mates to solve it. The rest I managed to figure out by looking up info on Stack Overflow and other sites, and one time I looked up someone else project on GitHub to see how they solved the problem. It turned out that I was mostly on the correct path, and that most of my errors were typos or that I forgot to put an alert() in the correct place and such. If I had more time I would love to add an counter and a timer, and to show the result on the win-or-lose-page. I would also like to style it a bit more, and it would be fun to add my own family instead. But the code is working now, and I'm satisfied with that.
