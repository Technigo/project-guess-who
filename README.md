The project was to complete the classic game of Guess who. 
The problem included creating an manipulate objects and arrays, using DOM and more complicated functions. Using methods like filter and forEach. 

It was a fun project and I had a better understanding for javascript this week. But since last week was a constant meltdown, I went in to this project a bit broken down. I focused on getting an some what early start, listen in on others on-call-sessions (even if they were ahead of me in the project), and make sure to not waste any time in the beginning if the week.

I followed the steps and made sure to read the brief carefully. My team, the Lions, hade a great week with a lot of open work sessions in our whereby-room. I had a moments when I could solve problems on my own, but mostly it included googling, stackoverflow and asking the team. To me, it is a positive development to actually knowing wthat to ask about (instead of just being clueless). 

I've got a better grasp of functions, variables and conditionals now. Can read the flow better. 

If I had more time I would study more and get an even better understanding for the functions and code I ahve used.
