# Project Name

This weeks assignment was to create a guess who-game using filter()

## The problem

At first, I felt overwhelmed by the assignment and when I saw the starting code I felt so confused. How was I supposed to solve this? What really helped me get through it was the guide in Notion that divided each part in different tasks. At times I got ahead of myself and got a bit lost, but as long as I got back to the guide everything became somewhat understandable in the end.
This time, I also got a lot of help from my groupe mates. Seeing their work made it easier to understand my own.

If I had more time I would have wanted to make a start page where you could choose to play the game instead of just getting straight into it.
