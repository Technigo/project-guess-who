This is what I completed:

ðŸ”µ Blue Level (Minimum Requirements)

The board with characters should be generated when website is loaded.
A randomly selected person should be set as the secret when game starts.
You should be able to select questions to ask about the people and filter the board based on those questions.
You should also give the player feedback with alerts
You should be able to guess on the secret person and get an answer if it's correct or not.
Make sure you've committed and pushed a version of your project before starting with the intermediary and advanced goals.

ðŸ”´ Red Level (Intermediary Goals)

Check the bonus step
Change the array of objects:
Add more information about the people, and with this add the possibility to ask questions and filter the board in regards to these addons.
Change the characters' info to be about your family, football club, colleagues, or cute dogs.
Create a counter to keep track of how many guesses a player does.
Change the styling to be as you want it!
âš« Black Level (Advanced Goals)

Create a timer that measures how long time each game takes.
The problem
If I had had more time, I would have worked on this:

Add sound effects and/or animations when flipping a card or winning the game.
Create the possibility to add a player name when starting the game.
