# Project Name

The "Guess-who"-project
Building a game based on the boardgame "Guess who?" using html, javascript and css.

## The problem

I followed the code along video from Technigo, and read all the material. Then I read the instructions to each step and tried to write comments to help myself understand the iteration process. It has been most efficiant to check Stack Overflow and all the answers and code snippets there. Asking the chat.openai for explinations to the code and googeling answers has helped me understand the code more. 

My focus is mainly on understanding the code so the design changes are poor or totaly lacking. My first goal is always to make the code work and then to really understand it.

If I had more time I would style it more and make a play again button. I tried to make it work but without success.
