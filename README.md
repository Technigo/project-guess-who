# Guess who?

A "guess who-game" that turned into a "guess where-game". An interactive game where the player needs to ask question to figure out the secret city that has been set. Depending on the players questions and if it applies to the secret city or not, cards get filtered out. 

## The problem

The game is built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
A starter code was provided from which I further developed the JavaScript and the CSS. I started with getting the game to work and then moving on to changing the theme of the game, changing the questions and the CSS.
If I had more time I would get the Play Again-button to work.
