# Guess Who? Zelda Edition

The purpose of this project was to create a working Guess Who? game. The computer selects a secret character, and the user needs to guess it. The user should be able to select questions that will allow them to narrow down characters and then make a guess. Throughout this process, the use should receive feedback from the game about their choices.  They should then be told whether or not they've guessed correctly. 

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

The instructions for this project were helpful in identifying how to break the process down into smaller steps.  However, for a few of the key mechanics of the game, I struggled to fully conceptualize just how small each step was, just how little each function should accomplish, and how to piece them all together. I travelled down two, lengthy cul-de-sacs (code-de-sacs, if you will) trying to figure how to filter the board based on the user's question selection before I started referring to other Guess Who games' code.  I looked at the Technigo Guess Who game as well as a few students from previous cohorts.  The combination was helpful to triangulate which code was relevant, and how to move forward without writing the next great American novel. 

I'm quite pleased that I was able to get the game working in time to then pursue the stretch goals.  I have included the functionality for users to replay the game after finishing (this ended up being trickier than I anticipated); changed the styling and characters to be from Zelda Breath of the Wild (which required a fair amount of adjusting categories, values, adding a new property with an array of values, and adjusting conditionals and alert verbiage); added a guess counter; and finally a count down timer (where I was nearly de-railed by an errant comma).
