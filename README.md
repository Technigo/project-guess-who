# Project Name
This project is part of the Technigo bootcamp autumn 2021, the goal was to learn about learning javascript and particularly array and object manipulation. Guess Who is the classic game remained in a web environment.

## The problem
The template from Technigo was a styled site that showed  the side bar with questions and an empty game board, some of the javascript was pre built. I started with hooking up an event listener to call the generateBoard function which places the photos in a grid on the board based on an array of characters. The select element to select question is auto generated from the characters array. 

The site is build with HTML, CSS, JS. The left side has a sidebar with the title and questions and buttons, the right part is the game area where all photos of the characters are placed.
