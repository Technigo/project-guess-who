# Project Guess Who game 

Week 2 project in Technigo Bootcamp. I needed to make the popular game "Guess Who" to work using JS, HTML and CSS. 

## The main problem was to understand how to make filtering in the game, as well how to use functions and event listeners in proper time in the code. 

I went many times for documantation and videos that we got with the project to understand how different things work in JS. It was a difficult assigment for week 2 for me, without previous knowledge about programming language. However, after many tries, help from classmates and coding mentors it works in the end. 

To improve in the future:
1. reload board after clicking restart button (the game restarts in console, but do not generate board.)
2. background pictures does not work fully properly in smaller screen, need to be fixed
