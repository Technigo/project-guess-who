# Project Guess Who?

The goal was to use JavaScript to create a fully functional classic Guess Who? game from a partially working template.

## The problem

Loading the game board was quickly sorted out. Then the more challenging problems started piling up. After hours consisting of a mixture of various code pages online, questions in Stack Overflow, bits and pieces from coding sessions, I was able to get the game working. Some important detail was given by other students in a chat on Discord before the demo. If I had more time, I might have replaced all the people with my own characters and come up with some more game features.
