# Project Name
Guess who ; 
In this game you are playing with the computer. Computer choosing a random character and u can  guess which the character is by narrowing down by asking diffrent questions. U can choose different options such as, hair, eyes color or accessories. 

I put the counter , player can try 5 times, if player would not win has to start a new game. 


## The problem

Filtering was a bit difficult to me, and Rest Game was not easy neither. 

For playagain finction I used location.reload() method in clickEventListener on the playAgain button. I checked Stackoverflow,I tried many diffrenet solutions, but just location.reload() method work well in my code. 

I didnot know the rule of this game. It took me a while to undestand what is require for this game.That was so complex for me to know how does it work and what they are expecting from theis game. Perhaps next time I will read many times the instruction and follow the instructions and do console.log as much as possibel for any singel function. 

If I had more time , I would add sound effects for winer or loser, and timer.
