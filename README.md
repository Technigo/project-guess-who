# Project Name

Project of week 2 was to create a Guess Who-game with the techniques of Javascript that we went through this week in Technigos Web Dev Boot Camp for Spring 2023.

## The problem

I went over the material from Technigo and I looked at previous student's code plus asked my teammates for help.
I managed to make a timer, I got the board to show but it feels like last week - I can get something to work but not the whole thing.

What's left to fix is how to generate the "Number of questions left" which should count down from 3 to 0 and then make the player have to guess.
I know there are somethings left to fix but I will commit and push this out to at least hand in on time.
I will reach out to my fellow boot camp-buddies for more help.

## View it live

I will deploy my project on Netlify and provide a link here.
This will be my last commit for today and then I will fix the changes requested with fresh eyes in the morning. :)
"The struggle is real"...
