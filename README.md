# Project Name

The goal of this project was to create an online version of the board game "Guess Who" using JavaScript.

## The problem

The main challenge was to make the JavaScript work. I first struggeled to even display the board game. After that worked and I got an understanding how the final product should look like, it was much smoother. The project helped a lot to get an deeper understanding of arrays, loops as well as objects.
