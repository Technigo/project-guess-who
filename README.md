# Super Guess Who

Super Guess Who. A classic Guess Who about super heroes from Marvel and DC 

## The problem

I started to understand each step by step of the game logic, what step should go first

I have used regular js methods and techniques such as:
- Arrow functions
- if statements 
- for each loop
- array and object manipulation

I have decided to replace some of the prompts logic with my own styled popup message

To solve this problem i have created a generic function to handle a global custom popup that receives 3 params (text of the message, quantity of buttons 1 or 2, and guess) with an if statement.

If i would have more time i would:
- add the time counter between each guessing
- add some sounds effects
- add a fliping card style to prevent removing characters from the array and just flip them down
