# Project Name

The assignment (in the 2nd week of the Javascript Spring in Technigo) was to build a digital version of the board game Guess who. 

## The problem

Being still quite new to Javascript, the project was challenging - and fun! Google, Stackoverflow and the Technigo community helped me understand more about arrays, filters and objects. If I had more time, I would have added a countdown to the numbers of questions the user was allowed to ask before he/she had to guess. The next step after that would have been to also introduce a timer (and therefore limiting the time the user has each game).
