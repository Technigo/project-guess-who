## Guess Who Game

This project is a traditional "Guess Who" game. The player signs their name to start the clock and them is presented with a board with 25 characters.

The player needs to guess the selected characters by filtering through character's traits from the drop down menu. The game filters and redraw the board with the remaining characters according to the question parameters.The player could also guess the secret character at any time.

## Features

- Display the players name
- Timer starts as soon as the board is generated
- Tracker of attempts
- Filtering function that discard characters
- Guess function that ends the game at any time
- Final screen with different sound effects if you win or lose

## Production Process

The project had steps that were quite clear to follow. I had some difficulties understanding where different functions should go, but with the help of my team I was able to fix some issues and get the game to work.

I divided the different features in separeted code sessions and that helped create a structured work flow throught out the production process.
