# Project Guess Who

A game where a player tries to figure who the secret character is by using descriptive questions.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

Straight forward approach. I read and followed the instructions to start and then used StackOverflow and ChatGPT when needed.
If I had had more time, I probably would have looked at trying to follow DRY more as there are a few cases of excessive repetition of code.
I would also have spent more time on configuring the CSS to something more "me".
I would also have looked at how to implement sounds when a user's guess on features is right or wrong. Currently it plays after the alert informing the player if they are right or wrong and that doesn't fit so I've commented it out.
