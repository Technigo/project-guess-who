# Project Name

This project is absout creating my own digital version of the classic board game Guess Who. I have practice creating objects and arrays and also connect this to the DOM.

Problems to solve:
✓ The board with characters should be generated when the website is loaded.

✓ A randomly selected person should be set as the secret when the game starts.

✓ You should be able to select questions to ask about the people and filter the board based on those questions.

✓ You should also give the player feedback with alerts

✓ You should be able to guess the secret person and get an answer if it's correct or not.

## The problem

Struggles a lot with filters and to get the buttons to work. Have not spend that much time at CSS for this project.
