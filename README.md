# Project Name
The aim this week was to build a game called "guess who?" using arrays and objects in javascript. 
This was a challenging project for me, alot of new concepts and methods in javascript was adopted. It was overwhelming and difficult to grasp all the new information.  

## The problem
My biggest challenge was the filtering of the characters, not only adopting conditionals, but also using array methods to retrieve variables inside an array. 
By taking it step by step, and along with a deep dive in to this issue during a code along session it helped me to better understand the logic behind it. 
Another problem was not being able to see my commits and changes on github, I suspect is being a different branch, to solve this, I re-cloned the project and pasted in my work from the file I had been working on. If I had more time, I would have liked to add a timer and a question counter.
