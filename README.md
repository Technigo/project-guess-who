This is a project made during the Technigo Bootcamp. 

# Guess who-game
The assignment was to build a digital version of the "Guess Who" game, to practice working with objects and arrays. I decided to keep most of the original code that we received for the assignment, and simply focused on getting it to work. In the "win or lose"-section I added a div with text and the name and image of the secret person.  

If I had more time I would have probably first added a counter and maybe a timer, and also changed a bit of the CSS so it would be more of my own work. Maybe also looking over the JS-code to see if it's possible to write the code more efficient/shorter.
