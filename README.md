# Project Name

The assigment was to build a Guess Who game using JavaScript.

## The problem

I approaced the problem by looking through the code and the steps needed to make the game work. I went through the steps one ny one and then moved on to the more advanced steps. I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript with methods as filter and include. I added music to it which was tricky because of disabled autoplay in browsers but managed to work around it using a button to start the game and get the user to interact and therefore start the music. The next step would be to add more keys and values to the characters and also make the dropdown a bit more clearer using better termonoligy and structure to the option groups.
