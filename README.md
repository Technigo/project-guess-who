# Project Name

The task was to create a digital version of the Guess Who game using Javascript.

## The problem

I started out by watching all the video material twice. Secondly, I completed the exercises with my team mates in small break-out groups. Then, using a Kanban board, I deconstructed the project into different steps and watched the code-along to get a better understanding of the starter code. After forking and cloning, I started out by completing the HTML and after that, I dove straight into the Javascript. 

To better understand what I needed the different functions to do in order for the game to work, I wrote the game steps in pseudocode, which I then translated into real code later on. I also looked at previous student's Github-projects and the live version of the game from Technigo. Whenever I got stuck, I asked my classmates or looked at questions in StackOverflow.

If I had had more time, I would have loved to change the characters and some of the styling to make it more my own. I would also have liked to add a timer & a guess counter.
