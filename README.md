# Guess who
Guess who game!
You play the game by changing the select menu and finding out if the 'secret person' has a certain characteristic. If they do the people that don't have that characteristic are filtered out. If the secret person doesn't have the thing you asked about, everyone that do are filtered out, eventually leading to only one person left. If you're feeling bold you can, however, take a guess at anytime during the game. But remember, you only get one guess!

## The problem - setting a timer

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

My plan was to make a timer that starts when the page is loaded and then stops when the game is over. The function I wrote for the counting of the seconds did not turn out very good. It looks fairly hard to read and there are more variables than perhaps is necessary, but it works for the most part. The thing that is bothering me is the fact that it pauses when there is a popup window, which happens everytime you click the find out button. From what I could find the pausing is just something that popups do, they paus the rest of the code, so it was not something I felt was important enough try to find a solution to.
