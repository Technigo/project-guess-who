# Guess who

This project is a little game based on the "Guess who" board game in order to practise JavaScript.

## The problem

The HTML and CSS of the project was given in the starter file, and most of the JavaScript as well. The task was to get the JavaScript that was already written to work in accordance with how the game is played out.
