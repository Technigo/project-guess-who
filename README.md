# Project Name

This weeks project was to create a digital version of the old Guess Who boardgame. 

## The problem
In this project I've used functions, objects, arrays, if statements, modal windows etc. I could not get the close (x) on the modal to work. The only way to close the modal is to click on the page outside of the modal.

For this project I found it really hard to ask the correct questions in order to solve the problem for each step. I have really had to read up alot and google alot. Stack overflow helped alot as well.

If I had more time I would have had another theme and pictures, add more features to the game such as a counter and have a certain amount of times to guess before game over. I would also have added some audio and a page with a "start game" button before the board gets loaded.
