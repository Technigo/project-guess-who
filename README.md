# Project Name

This week we were tasked with making a Guess who game

## The problem

We had alot of starting code(thank you) so at first it was mostly to understand everything, getting the code to work(invoke and generate) figuring out how to move forward, i learned alot from Daniels lession, from all the great questions on stackOverflow. 
My plan was to get everything to work, which took longer then expected, alot of frustraing moments and alot of happy moments, its a real roller coaster.

If i had more time, a would add a counter, and try diffrent things. add more characters and styling.
