# Guess who-game
The assignment was to build a digital version of the "Guess Who" game, to practice working with objects and arrays. I decided to keep most of the original code that we received for the assignment, and simply focused on getting it to work. I got to be a bit creative with the "win or lose"-section though, where I added a div with text and the name and image of the secret person.  

## The problem
I simply aimed to get the game to work; attending the lectures, googling and discussing with my team (which was super helpful in this assignment). I had a lot of problems with getting the "try again-button" on the "win or lose-page" to work after I added text with .inneHTML. I ended up putting a separate div in the HTML-file where I then added the text and image with javascript. I also had to move the button so it was outside the original win or lose-div, othervise it wouldn't work. 

If I had more time I would have probably first added a counter and maybe a timer, and also changed a bit of the CSS so it would be more of my own work. Maybe also looking over the JS-code to see if it's possible to write the code more efficient/shorter.
