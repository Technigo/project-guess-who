# Project Name

Creating a digital board game, "Guess who".
Practising on arrays and objects.

## The problem

I followed the guidance in the presentation step-by-step and set my goal on blue level.
I think it was really tricky and focused on trying to understand basics as much as possible.
In the end I managed to fix some red levels as well, so that I'm proud of.
We helped each other a lot in  our team as well.
