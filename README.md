# Project Name

This project was to create a whos´s there game focusing on arrays, objects and filtering functions using Javascript and some HTML.

## The problem

This project was quite tricky to understand. I spent a lot of time getting the logic and used chatGPT and Google to find answers. I had to console log a lot to see what was actually happening and I tried to figure out how to connect everything in the code.
If I had more time I would´ve liked to get in to the stretch goals, for example adding a timer and sound to the game board.
