# Guess Who Project

The project was to create a digital version of the old character guessing board game Guess Who?

## The assignment

For this project I was given most of the styling and HTML structure. I focused mostly on JavaScript and approach the assignment step by step.

If I had more time I would have wanted to create a timer that measures how long time each game takes, create a counter to keep track of how many guesses a player does and maybe personalize the project a bit thru styling.
