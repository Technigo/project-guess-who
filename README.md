# Project Guess Who

Creating an app/game that looks like the old board game Guess Who!

## The problem

I had som trouble commit through with the filter function. Due to having a lot of arrays in the object keys made it a bit difficult to get the correct filtering going. But with a lot of going back and forth in the team with managed to figure it out.

I´m still at war a bit with FlexBox but I´m getting there.
