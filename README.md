# Project Name

A 'guess who' game that filters the cards based on user selection. The game selects a new "secret person" every time new board is loaded and you win by correctly guessing who it is.

## The problem

The problem for me was to understand categories, values and parameters in the objects. I had to rely on coursemates code to debug and get it working (almost completely). At the time of submission the there is no working Timer-reset function when game is restarted (only on page refresh).
