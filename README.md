# Project Name

This weeks project was to create a digital version of the old Guess Who boardgame. 

## The problem
In this project I've used functions, objects, arrays, if statements, modal windows etc. 

I find it really hard to ask the correct questions in order to solve the problem that I have. I have had to google alot and use stack overflow more than I had to before.

If I had more time I would have had another theme and pictures, add more features to the game such as a counter and have a certain amount of times to guess before game over. I would also have added some audio and a page with a "start game" button before the board gets loaded.
