# project-guess-who

The project is about building a digital version of the classic board game Guess Who using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## The problem

There was a lot of information to this project, and it was hard not to get confused. Generating the board and setting ut the 'secret' persen went fairly easily.

I struggeled a bit from step 3 and forward. There was a lot of tips how to move forward, some strategically placed clues, but just grasping it all and how to start was really difficult. I used console.log a lot to try to understand if my code was working or not as I went forward. There was too much logic/code missing during the project s√• console-logging was the only way to see if the code worked.

At first, just knowing in what order to do things, made me dizzy. Being such a noob makes it quite challenging to grasp the layout and in which order things need to happend.

Ther's quite a long if statement that looked hard to do at once, but then it went better further down I got. This should be made shorter and so it's easier to maintain, but at the moment it's devided into the different categories so it works.

If I had more time I would love to play around with the timer and a counter. It makes the game more fun.

I used different techniques during this project:
Functions: breaking down code inte functions for modularity and reusability
Variable Scoping: Understand the difference between global and local scope and trying to avoid polluting the global namespace to prevent conflicts
Event handling: use event listeners to respond to user interactions
DOM manipulation: Select and manipulate DOM elements

### Requirements for this project:

- The board with characters should be generated when the website is loaded.
- A randomly selected person should be set as the secret when the game starts.
- You should be able to select questions to ask about the people and filter the board based on those questions.
- You should also give the player feedback with alerts
- You should be able to guess the secret person and get an answer if it's correct or not.

I have completed all these steps.

### Stretch goals

Intermediate:
*The Bonus step felt easy enough to attack, but it still took some thinking to get it right.
*Changed the styling a bit just for fun.

Advanced stretch goals:
*Sound. I haven't added sound to any of my projects before so I wanted to try it at this one. And it worked!
*N
