# Project Name

The purpose of this project was the get the guess-who game up and running, and to style it a bit if we had time.

## The problem

I spent ages on trying to figure out why my code did not work, I could see in console logs that things should be there, but in "reality" it wasn't happening. It turned out that changing the optgroup label to start with a capital letter was the thing that made nothing else work. When that was fixed, the rest worked as it should.
