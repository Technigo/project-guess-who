## GUESS WHO PROJECT

The purpose of this project was to learn how to use arrays, forEach-loops and objects in JavaScript. We put into practice as well knowledge about scope and closures in JavaScript.

## WHAT I LEARNED

The project gave me more clearity about scope and the control flow in JavaScript. 

It was useful to have part of the code already provided as we could focused on what is important to learn and be able to see a functional and styled page in the end.
