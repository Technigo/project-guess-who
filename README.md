# Guess who game

This week the assignment was to make a Guess who game with the use of JavaScript.

## The problem

I started with reading code from some of the earlier students. After that I went through the given code step by step to make each part work. When the basics worked I added a counter of guesses and a timer for each round. I also added sounds for when the player wins or loses. If I had more time I would have styled the game board to be something of my own and I would have changed the alerts.
