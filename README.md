# Guess who game

A digital version of the board game Guess who using JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

## The problem

Most time consuming was to understand the starter code and the different parts of the assignments. I broke it down into smaller steps in order to not be overwhelmed. 

Great sessions with my team where we all helped each other out, course material and chatGPT was used to understand objects and arrays.

With more time I would do the stretch goals. I found it important, at this time, to understand the basics. In order to do so I spent time going through my code and understand it better instead of doing stretch goals.
