Everything was a problem, and I wasnt really sure how to tackle the problem and/or where to start. I used the instrution videos a lot and what Daniel had talked about in the lessons. Looking at all the recorded videos from the sissions.
I also tried a lot of google, stack overflow queries and past projects.
At the end i had to get a lot of help from a programer friend.
