## The problem

I felt like this week was a little easier, so I decided to change photos and add different chatagories and values, and everything got messed up. I made a duplicate and went back to my old code. I will try to fix the issue tomorrow, but at least this code works. 

tuesday 12.09.23
I started working on the code again after sunday; to change the theme, pictures, add another chategory and I also wanted to the option text to appear in the alert and not the value. 

with the option text Sakura Tanaka helped me figure out the "textForAlert", she gave suggestions I could try and it worked. I kept overcomplicating it, I tried removewhite space and trim() but I don't thing any of them actually do what I tried to. After I failed finding a soultion I reached out to her cuz she had solved the text vs value in her code. 

I truggeled quite a bit with adding another option to my game. First I didn't think of adding other: [] property to all my "character objects". Then I struggeled with the charactersInPlay filtering. I think the soulution was: return !keep; But at this point I'm quite confused. 

I decided not to start changing the word "person" in my code even if my new theme is guess song and not person in: "charactersInPlay.forEach((person) => {})" because I honestly didn't want to risk messing anything up.

I still havent assigned the correct values to correct song (If you are a swiftie you know), and I still have quite a bit css styling to do, but for now I need to focus on this weeks project. 

I also have to go trough all my comments and remove what no longer is necessary. I wrote qute a lot to try to keep track of what I was doing, but I think it's too much now.
