# Guess Who?
The assigment was to create a digital version of the classic board game Guess Who and to practice creating objects and arrays and also connect it to the DOM. 

## The problem
I remember playing the game as a kid and since the game logic is pretty simple I didn't think it was going to be as challenging as it turned out to be. At first I had a hard time trying to understand the code that was given to us. I went on GitHub to see how others had solved it and when I had seen a few different approaches I understood how it worked and after that I started making my own decisions. I guess you can say that I worked my way backwards, but it was still a great learning process by the end of the day.
