# Project 'Guess Who'
The assignment was to build a website with the classic game 'Guess Who'. We had default HTML and CSS to begin with so the focus was to continue with the javaScript-file. The website should at least include the following: Generating game-board, randomly selecting secret person, dropdown with attributes that player can choose from, feedback with alerts and ability to guess on a person and getting response if it's the right person or not.

## The problem
I started with reading through the existing code and figuring out what it did and what features it included in the actual website. Then I followed the recommended steps one by one starting with generating the board and ending with making the player able to play again after a completed game.

I used a lot of conditionals, since it is a game where people will be filtered out depending on attributes. I stored the players choices in variables, added functions that for example made it possible to replay the game. I added some eventlisteners for buttons and some alerts to give the player feedback.

If I had more time, I would add a welcome-screen with a hello-message and a form where the player can write their name. I would also add a timer and a number of guesses. Lastly I would add some personal design and change the images, and add some sound effects.
