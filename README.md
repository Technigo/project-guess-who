# Project Name

The goal of this project was to create a Guess who? game where the user can filter the characters based on several characteristics.

## The problem

I got the basic functionality running quite early, so I was able to experiment with my code and re-write it with as few lines of code as possible. I also had the time to do some styling, add some media queries, and add extras such as the guess counter, the timer and the list of guesses made.
