This weeks peoject was to learn more about javaScript. The project was to make a game that workes like the classic game guess who with help of different functions and conditional statments etc.

I used the code and layout we got with the assignment and concentrated on learning more about the javaScript, the functions,objects,arrays,loops and scopes etc. I google a lot and asked for help in my team and at townhall session.
