# Project Name

Week 5 of technigo bootcamp. Build a "guess who game". 

## The problem

I tried to follow the pre-studies as much as possible and the steps on notion. 
This was a good practice on arrays and objects! We hade good conversations about each step in our group. 
If i had more time I would style it more and also add a counter. If I would start over I would plan it a bit more, maybe draw a timeline of my own, now i keept with the steps on notion as mentioned.
