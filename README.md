# Project Name

The project was to build a guess-who type of game using javascript. Creating, manipulating and deleting arrays were the highlight of this project.

## The problem

I received much of my knowledge from past projects, videos and stack overlfow. I kept discussions open with team mates bugs and ways and means of getting the project to function as it should. 

I made it a murder mystery themed game and so changed the character images and info to suit it. I also used alertifyJS to add custom promts and alerts to the game. 

To make it better, I would like to add a countdown timer instead of a stopwatch timer like there is now. I would also like to improve the media queries so that the game looks as it should on various devices.
