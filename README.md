# Project Name

Guess who - GAME. This weeks project was really difficult. The importance of a team is really obvious when you struggle. 
I managed to get it to work with a lot of help and explanations from team members and code coaches. Added some sound even :-) (Not the hardest part ðŸ˜…)


## The problem

A lot of code written, it is a bit hard to take over someone elses code. That is something to really practice! 
The syntax in the language is not easy. But I think that some parts acctually has landed, in my head.
