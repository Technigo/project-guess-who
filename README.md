# Project Guess Who

My task was to build a browser version of the old school board game Guess Who, in order to practice creating objects and arrays in JavaScript, and connecting these to the dom.

## The problem

Since my JavaScript abilities are limited I made sure to follow the steps given in the instructions.

### If I had more time

- Change the styling (make it mobile first because easier to follow) and then move the sections around
- Improve filter alerts, i.e. customise them better and not have the exact option values being displayed in them
- Replace the cards with something cute like Pokemons or cats and then also re-doing the categories to better fit the new characters
- Add Guess counter that counts down from 3

### Technologies used:

- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

- [JSConfetti](https://github.com/loonywizard/js-confetti) for confetti effects user wins or loses

- [Prettier](https://www.prettier.io/) for code linting
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for deployment
