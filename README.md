# Guess who?
This weeks project was to build a Guess Who? game. The main focus of the project was javascript funtions, objects and arrays. 

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?
My main focus this week was to truly understand my javascript code. Therefore I really took the time to read and slowly go through the steps-guide provided by Technigo. I asked questions, and got answers, on SO and worked a lot together with my teammates. I also did a Figma sketh for the game plan. 

If I had more time I would have wanted to clean up and shorten my code more than I was able to do.
