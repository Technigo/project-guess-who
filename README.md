# Project Name

My guess who is a simple version of the game where you with a few questions come to guess on a person, in this one using objects and arrays.

## The problem

I had towo issue, the first one was that the question was stuck on one value ll of the time. After examining the code I saw I did a double take on that part of the code and after i removed a chunk from the code it worked.

I had another issue regarding the game always saying yes to every value even if it should be wrong. With that one I asked my team and had excellent help from one of my teammates.

I think this is the week thing are actually starting to click, I can see how I could use this at work for a fun partygame and also how much you can learn by just looking at the code and see how it connects. I still have a long way to go but babysteps right!
