# Project Name

The assignment was to create a game where a character is selected and you have to guess which the character is by narrowing it down by asking questions.

## The problem

As it was an individual project I first made a schedule for when to work on it and then went through the starter code to familiarize myself in it.
After beginning with the project I approached my classmates both with questions on stack overflow but also by programming together to be able to share ideas live and troubleshoot more efficiently.

If I had more time (and I definitely needed more time) I would like to start with programming the bot a bit more from scratch to really understand what the starter code did.
I would also like to add a timer as well as an area where the user can fill in a nickname before starting the game.
