# Who Ate My Cookies!

I made this game for my son. I drew and created the characters for him, and he even made some of the creatures for this game.

## The problem

I wanted to make my version of this assignment and probably managed to do it. Next time I will not make 25 characters but focus only on coding :-D

In general, this was a demanding task in this time slot. (I was also forced to do a photo shoot middle of the week and was forced to work during the weekend.) 

I did pretty good documentation of my javascript to truly understand what it does.

I spend a lot of time tweaking the CSS, and there is still some stuff with mobile/tablet versions. I'm not too happy. I will probably ask some of these things from Daniel at the beginning of this week.

One detail about the game: sometimes, you end up in a situation where you need to guess from several options. That is a feature, not a bug because sometimes you do not know who ate your cookies even if you tried to be clever with your detective work. -That's life ;-)
