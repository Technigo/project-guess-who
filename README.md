# Project Name

This project was made as part of Technigo bootcamp. The assignment was to make a classic Guess Who? game from some already made code and make it work using javascript. 

## The problem
I started by reading through all the code that was there from the start to make sure I understood it all. I spent the first couple of days to try to make it work by following the guidelines of the project. The hardest parts was to figure out the filter where the persons are taken away or left based on what the user asked. I tried a few different alternatives before getting it to work smoothly. 

Since I had some time to spare I continued with the stretch goals and made the game my own. I decided I wanted to make a game that my nieces and nephews could play and I translated the game to Swedish and went for a baby animal theme. 

## If you had more time, what would be next?
- I would continue with the black stretch goals and add some animations to the cards like a flip or cool hover animation. 
- I would also like to include a timer or even a score chart which would display who has played the best game so far and their time and number of guesses.
