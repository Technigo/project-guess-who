# Guess-Who
This is a guessing game where basically each function filters and removes a characther that doesnt fit the 
users selected elements. 
 

## The problem


The problem, well, its quite embarassing really. One of the biggest issues was all the else/if statements for the hair/eyes and accessories. For some reason I added to many and the code became so blurry and unreadable it took me a long time to figure it out. 
One of the primary issues for this week was actually time, life and work happend so I was really pressed for time. 

Another one was the audio, which I actually gave up on at the last minute. I wanted an autoplay function for some background music for when the page is loaded for the first time but to my understanding this is usually blocked in most standard browsers? 

What would I do if i had more time? 
So for this project, my initial plan was to make the theme of the game be Pirates of the caribbean. 
However it took all the time I had to finnish the basics of this assignment, which is unfortunate.
