# Project Guess Who

This assignment was part of Technigo web development bootcamp for week 2.

We were tasked with creating a "Guess Who" game, to practice using array manipulation methods, working with objects and implementing loops. The user should be able to filter out objects by asking questions, to finally make a guess on which one of these objects the game has randomly selected to be the secret person.

## The problem

For this project and this particular week, I had very little time and struggled with the stress of making it work in time. I followed my usual process of going through the code step by step and implementing features one by one until I ran into problems, which was very helpful this week.
Since time was short, I also started looking at old students projects and worked my way backwards, understanding what they tried to do for each step in different ways and how I could adjust it to fit my project. Some reverse-engineering! 

I used the images and data we got in the example code from Technigo, but if I had more time, I would like to make it more of my own project and think of ways to make it more creative and fun.

I would also spend more time playing around with the array and loop methods, to get more comfortable with that.
