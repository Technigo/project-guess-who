# Project Name

The project was to creat a game called guess who and make the game work. 

## The problem

This week I my biggest problem was to try to understand all the code that was given and to apply the instructions and build on the code. sometimes I got stuck but mainly to realise that I had just missed something small or a typo somewhere. But once I understood what I was doing it was quite smooth I asked my team a lot and also reached out in the on call for help when I really couldn't figure it out. If I had more time I would like to add more effects, either a time counter or some animations. I would also want to add different messages for the win or lose element.
