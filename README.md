# Guess Who by Saralie

Sprint 1, week 2 assignment at Technigo. Focus on javascript to make a digital version of the classical board game Guess Who.
Requirements were to: Set a secret person for each round that you should guess on. Dependent on which attributes you chose, the game should filter out possible candidates that could be the secret person. 

## The problem

I had a lot of problem getting the if else loops to work, my code always skipped the else part of the code. I solved it by declaring the "let keep" to false and let keep = true in the if statement. This made the function to work. I wanted to keep the code as simple as possible so i combined all the strings(hair/eyes/gender) in one condition and the arrays (cathegories/other) in another. Next step is to change the styling, set a timer or a count down function, and also to make the alert messages in a nicer way. I would like to have a start screen as weel.
