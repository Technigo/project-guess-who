# Guess Who by Jonas

A Guess Who-game where player asks questions about the persons attributes to find out who the secret person is.

Step by step other persons are ruled out until player are ready to make a guess. If guess is correct player wins the game.

## The problem

I used a starter code holding the basic html and css and built the game logic using JavaScript. With different if-statements player's selected question value was tested on secret person and based on the result a filter function was used to redraw the characters in the gameboard.
