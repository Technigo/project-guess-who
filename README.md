# Project Name

This is my Lord of the Rings themed version of the project-guess-who, called Guess Who: Middle-Earth Quest!

## The problem

Compared to last week, I found this project a lot more straight-forward. The instructions really held my hand through the process. The mechanics of the game were quite easy to understand in code (like which function is supposed to happen after what and so on), but I still struggle a lot with coming up with the right syntax for each function. I still need a lot of help with this and have searched for the solutions so much more than come up with them myself.

One thing I was stuck with for days was making the "play again" button work. I tried every solution I could find on Stack Overflow and got a few suggestions from team mates as well, but at first nothing worked. Then I finally posted my repo on Stack, and two of my lovely teammates helped me to solve the problem, finally! Well, solving that one did lead to another few bugs but luckily I was able to fix them myself.

The styling, however... admittedly, I love styling my projects and procrastinated a lot with starting the JavaScript by just fixing the color scheme, fonts and pictures. I even made my own Guess Who logo with Photoshop. What can I say, I love it. And I'm really happy with the result. Maybe it did take a little too much of my time for this project though, as the point was the JS and not the CSS...

## View it live

Note: a disappointing surprise with deploying my game was that the html audio player I put on the corner doesn't work anymore :( Worked fine with the live server but not in the deployed version. So it is highly suggested to listen to some LOTR tunes while playing this game.
