# Project Name

The assignment was to build a guess-who game, focusing on the functions of javascript such as filters and arrays.

## The problem

I decided to keep the code as simple as possible, following the iterations handed to us from Technigo. I had to focus on each function to get an understanding of what was happening in the code.
