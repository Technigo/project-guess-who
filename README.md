# Guess Who - project

The assignment was to build the classic Guess Who game with the help from some pre-written code.

## The problem

I approached this task a little different from the last one. I started this week by going back and thoroughly reading and watching everything we learnt about Javascript so far and then continued watching this weeks videos.
Daniels codesession talking about arrays was really usefull.

After that I coded along with Matilda when she built the "pre-written code" that we got in the Git Hub repo. After that I made the first 4 steps and tried to figure out how it all was connected. By talking with my teammates we tried to explain to each other how we should move forward. We watched some different approaches on how to do that and tried the one that we could manage to understand. And this was a success.

When the game was up an running I started with the styling. I decided to draw my one figures with pen and paper - 
taking pictures of the drawings and remove the background (coz the pictures that did come with the project did not have a background). Then I did some css and added the soundeffect.
