# Project-Guess-Who  Emelie Cruz

This week's project is about creating a Guess Who Game using Javascript.

Most of the HTML and CSS came with the template from Technigo. The repo was a fork from https://github.com/Technigo/project-guess-who


## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

I started reading the code and the instructions. Then I read a teammates code to try to understand the different functions and how to go about with the assignment. Once understanding more about the connection between all the elements, functions and eventlisteners I started from Step 1 and followed all the steps provided. I was stuck a long time at step 1-3 because I couldn't click the FIND OUT button. Later I realized I had not made a DOM selector. The filterfunction I straight out copied and I spent a lot of time trying to understand it. I kind of understand the concept now but I would not be able to write it myself still. 

When I was done with the blue level requirements I wanted to add a timer. This I found in Johanna Mannest√•ls code. It was a struggle to google more info on how the timer worked. The role of parseInt for exampel. 

Even though I dont feel that I understand everything in the code it helped a lot in widening my understanding of arrays and objects in JavaScript.
