# Project Name

This weeks assignment was to create a Guess who game with JavaScript. Practicing functions, arrays and objects.

## The problem

The problem for me this week was to be able to figure out how to check my code. I'm not that comfortable to use consloe.log yet, but I've practiced it a lot this week. It was difficult to figure out where all the pieces were to be placed within the code. However it was a fun project and hopefully I can build a similar one in the future. Had I had more time I would have liked to change all the charaters to other ones. But now my focus was on figuring out the JS. But I will build a new game in the future, with Bravo celebs!
