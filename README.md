# Project Name

This project was about creating a virtual version of the game Guess Who. The main functionalities of the game were created with Javascript.


## The problem

I started my process with getting to know the starter code and the project instructions. I drafted the steps and the logic of the game using Figma which helped me in forming the actual functions for the game.

The game characters were listed as objects inside an array. The filtering of the game characters during the game was done by using the filter() and includes() methods. Invoking different commands inside the functions was done by using conditional statements. The guesses of the player were handled with the confirm() method and the player was given alert messages during the game according to the guesses they made. 

I added audio effects to the buttons, character cards and for the win or lose message that the player receives in the end of the game. I also added a video effect to the end of the game.

For the styling I added some animation to the character cards and styled the backgrounds of the question and win or lose sections.

With more time, I would have liked to add a feature where the player can fill in their player name before the game starts. Also I would have liked to add a timer feature and try styling the alert messages.
