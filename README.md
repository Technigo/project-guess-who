# Project Name

I've created a Guess Who game which is based on the old board game. Have mainly focused on the JS part with objects, array methods and manipulating the DOM. Also added an input for the player name and a question counter.

## The problem

I had some issues in the beginning just getting the game to work. But googling is always very helpful, watching the lectures and I also practice some of the methods in code academy to understand them more and how to apply them. But mostly just trying my way forward, it can take some time but when finally getting it to work feels great! :) 
If I had more time I would have liked to add some animation to the cards when flipping them, and maybe so you could play against another player but that probably would have required a looot more work.
