## Guess who!

The assignment consisted of creating a "guess who-game" where the player tries to find out which of the persons on the board is the chosen one. The requirements were to generate the board, randomly select a person as the secret, making it posible to ask questions and then filter the board based on the answers. The player should get feedback in form of alerts. 

## The problem

This assignment meant many small problems one after another. Without discussing the project and looking att other peoples code I did get stuck ALL THE TIME. This project forced me to accept that I sometimes have to use code that I don´t understand completely, and just let the learning take it´s time.
