# Project Name

This project was about making the classical board game "Guess Who?" into a functioning online game using Javascript, practising array methods such as .filter .includes etc. 

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

I started by watching all of this week's Technigo lessons and did the team exercises with a couple of my team mates. Then I continued by following the code-along before starting working on my own repo, going through the project instructions one by one. It went pretty well until I got to step 4 where i got a bit stuck with how the logic of the different functions and filters, how they needed to be set up to work as they should. I reached out to my team and started trying to figure things out by discussion and looking at previous students solutions for the code. There was apparently many different solutions but after some trial and error and getting help on stackOverflow I got my game to kind of work. In the end the main problem that made my game not work was that I forgot to put the setSecret()-function into the start()-function to get it running. It made all the difference!
