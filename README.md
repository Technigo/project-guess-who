# Project Name

This weeks project was about building the classic game "Guess Who" using JavaScript. In this project I did this: 

- Created and manipulated objects
- Created and manipulated arrays
- Used array methods such as `forEach()` and `filter()`
- Manipulated the DOM using Javascript
- Structured code in functions
- Worked with game logic

## The problem

I started with creating an overview over the starter code. Checking the given elements, functions and so on. Then I went on step by step. 
If I would have more time, I would work more on the styling and think about better texts to be displayed to the user.
