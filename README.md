## Guess Who project

The purpose of this project was to learn how to use arrays, forEach-loops and objects in JavaScript. We put into practice as well knowledge about scope and closures in JavaScript.

## What I learned

The project gave me more clearity about scope, the control flow in JavaScript and the use of arrays and objects in JS.
It was useful to have some parts of the code already provided as we could focus on the learning goals and see in the end a functional and styled website.
If I've had more time I would have styled the website in a more personal way.
