This is a project made during my fifth week at the Technigo bootcamp. The learning objectives was to learn more about creating objects, arrays and loop through them as well as continue working with functions.

# Guess Who - game

The objectives were practiced by continue building the classic board game Guess Who; finishing up several functions and objects. Create new functions and loops to pick out values, compare them and store them.

## The problem

As always, the work began by cloning a repo from github to VSCode. This time I've used the developer tools in chrome more than before and learned the greatness of it, meaning I also practiced console.log for troubleshooting a lot. Also I feel I am starting to find a way to work more and more, focusing on small pieces one at a time. Breaking down the problem to smaller pieces certainly makes it more magageable. If i had more time I would add some more styling and change the pictures.
