Project Guess Who

The project was to create my own digital version of the old character guessing board game "Guess Who?".

## The problem

I started with the project by watching the given tutorials and reading material. Then I proceeded by reading and trying to understand the starter code that came within the project. By following the brief I went through the different steps and solved the problems. I got help from my team, we decided to work in a shared coding session which I thought was really helpful because you had someone to talk through the problems with and I learned a lot from that. When I understood the structure and have completed the blue level I repeated my code and added more questions, sound effects and changed some of the styling. For this project it was helpful to understand the differences of strings and arrays and the proper way to use them. I am extra proud of the sound effects that changes depending on your guess and if it is wright or wrong. If I had more time I would have liked to create a counter to keep track of how many guesses a player does.
