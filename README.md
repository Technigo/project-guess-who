# Project Name

The brief was to create a Guess-Who style game using javascript, where a character is randomly selected and the user has to guess the character by filtering the list by asking questions.

## The problem

I first thought of which characters I wanted to use, which was characters from the video game Animal Crossing. After that, I made an Airtable(similar to Excel) where I added all of their characteristics, as well as img srcs. I then exported the table to a csv file, and used an online tool to change the csv to a javascript object array.

I didn't plan anything this time besides the characters. Monday morning I opened up the forked repo, and began reading through it to see if I could understand the starter code we were given. As I was sitting with it, I started "filling in the blanks" - and suddenly I was consumed by the project, and I don't think I looked up from my screen again until around 21.30 PM that night, surprised that I had finished it.

Instead of adding sounds, I wanted to focus on doing something I thought was fun - which was making some custom alerts. I uploaded the project to the demo channel Tuesday. Wednesday morning Amanda made me aware of a bug with my custom alerts. I spent the rest of Wednesday trying to fix it with the help of Amanda and Jennie.

I spent a lot of my time console logging trying to debug, which I think was one of the things I learned the most from during this project.

I did have more time to work on the project, but I stopped for my own sanity this week. Maybe if I had more energy, I would like to filter the drop-down options in the menu in the same way that we filter the characters on the board.
