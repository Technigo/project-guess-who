# Sprint 1 , Week 2 - Guess Who 

I have build the game "Guess who" for week 2 project. We have recived start code from Technigo in HTML, CSS and Javascript. Guesse who is a responsie app where we have used javascript to make the game work. 


## The problem

I started to plan how the game should work and then started with the start code to build the game. I added a counter for how many guesses as an extra for this game. 
I have been using stackoverflow, google and youtube to help me solve the problems.
