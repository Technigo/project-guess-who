# Linn√©as Guess Who

We were assigned to create a guess who game.

## The problem

Approach:
I started by examine the startercode we were given and tried to understand how to piece everything together. After that I started to examine the functions, how they're supposed work, what they do and what I need to add to make it work. When something didn't work/I got error messages in the console I started by asking myself "what need to happen for this to work?" and worked backwards from there. It could be to add an eventlistener or to call a function at the right moment. 

If I had more time:
I did the css last and I wanted to make it look like the cards were flipping on a table. But when I started to look into it I realised I would have to change the structure of the code and I didn't have time for it.
