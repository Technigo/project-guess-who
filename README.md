# Project - Guess Who Game

This weeks project was about understanding more JavaScript, objects, arrays and loops and how to use 
methods like forEach and filter.

## The Problem
I approached this week by a bit more structure in how to go about the project and taking advantage of former solutions of coding for similar tasks. I used technigos turtorials, practices technigo gave where helpful due to knowing more how to search on google. I used Stackoverflow more this week.
