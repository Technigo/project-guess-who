# Project Name
The task was to create a "Guess who"-game with focus on the JS.


## The problem

I had problem with getting the SelectQuestion to work, meaning - when choosing for example "Brown hair" the alert would say "Sorry, the person doesn't have brown hair" and then filter these people. But after asking the question in Stack overflow I got some great help, I updated the eventListener from "Click" to "Change" and also uodated the HTML with a "disabled selected".

If I had more time I would add some more attributes to the people and also replace the "alert-box" with a new screen-view instead.
