# Guess who gameboard 

The game Guess Who, created by using forEach, loops, arrays and if else.

## The problem

I had a problem with getting the "checkQuestion" to work properly. When selecting accessories, it still filtered out the people wearing them. I had a hard time figuring out what was wrong, even with help from teammate, stackOverflow and google. So I decided to go with another solution and changed my approach and code completely - and it worked. I decided, after many hours trying to figure out what was wrong because I wanted to understand, to admit defeat to that particular part of the code.
Overall I worked from top to bottom, following instructions in notion. If i had more time i'd add a timer, style the board more and add more attributes to the characters.
