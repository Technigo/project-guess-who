# Guess who - Annoying people 

This is my version of Guess Who. Good luck. You're going to need it. 

## The problem

This week, we were a group of people who decided to get going on the project together, being online in our Jitsi room. It was a great help when someone got stuck to be able to share screen and help each other out. I focused on the exercises, videos and other material Monday and Tuesday and worked on the project the rest of the week. I decided to do my own illustrations for the game, therefore I skipped doing some other things like the counter. If I had more time I would definitely add that.
