# Project Name

"Guess Who" is a board game where the user guess on what person the opposite player (the script in this case) have a secret person that the opponent has to figure out who it is by making guesses that filter out people on the gameboard.

## The problem

In very small iterations i started just figuring out what each code elements did as a learning process. Since im not a boardgame-person myself, i needed to map out the game events bit by bit on a piece of paper, and from there figure out what i needed the script to actually do, and when. This was very helpful going back to and visualize what i wanted to happen at each point.
