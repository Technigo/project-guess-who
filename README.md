# Guess Who - the game 

Week 2 of Technigos web dev bootcamp.
Our task was to create a digital version of the good old boardgame "Guess Who".
By doing so we needed to practice the use of array manipulation methods, work with objects and implement loops. The challenge was to enable users to filter out objects by posing questions related to predefined characteristics and, ultimately, to make a guess on which one of theese the game randomly has selected to be our secret person. 
I wanted to update the game a little and created monsters through AI and changed our pre-set design to be more monstrous themed and re-named the game to Guess what to be more fitting to the individuals on the board. 

## ðŸ¥Š The problem

I started by going through the code step by step and implementing the needed features one by one. When an issue occured I went to old students projects as a way of trying to work my way backwards on how to solve my issues and understand the code step by step. By doing so I got a bigger understanding of the project as a whole and what they've done to grasp the flow and code needed.

If I had more time I would make it bug free, as of now the sorting is not 100% right all of the time. A would also added more accessoring and changed the look of the pop up alerts.
