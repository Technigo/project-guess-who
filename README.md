# Guess-who

The assignment was to make a functional guess-who game.

## The problem

I actually had a much easier week of grasping the code then last week. This week was a proof that I've learned a lot about functions etc in JS and how to apply the same thoughtprocess as we used last week on a new project.

I started out with just finishing the basic project and then made some alterations to try to refine the code as much as possible with the knowledge I have at the moment.

If i would have chosen to take more time for the project i would probably make a box for the user to put in her/his name.
