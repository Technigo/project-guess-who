# Project Name

The purpose of this project was to learn how to use arrays, forEach-loops and objects in JavaScript. We put into practice as well knowledge about scope and closures in JavaScript.

## The problem

The project gave me more clearity about scope and the control flow in JS. I sometimes had difficulties on understanding the instructions but talking to other classmates helped me to understand.

I noticed I still struggle with the different syntax with functions and how to set them up so I had to practice on my own writting one function in different ways.

It was useful to have part of the code already provided as we could focused on what is important to learn and be able to see a functional and styled page in the end.

The step 4 was very challenging for me as I got an error message, the program couldnt read the type property. In the end I got help from a classmate to be able to move forward as saving that value in a variable did not solved the problem work.
