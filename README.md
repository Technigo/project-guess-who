# Project Name

Creating a Guess Who game using arrays, objects, conditionals, nested function, filter and other kinds of javascript methods.

## The problem

My approach was to play around and test out the concepts. My focus to make the javascript function and finding out more through the bugs in the console. Besides arrays and filter, I learnt about insertAdjacentHTML, as it will not deactivate the eventListeners. When I had finished, I added some extra features: the counter, the timer and some animations. If I had more time I would have focused more on different jacascript methods.
