# 'Guess Who'

This week we create a browser version of the classic board game Guess Who.

## The problem

I started by trying to understand the HTML, CSS and JS codes provided by Technigo. Then I followed the guidance. I tried to keep the code clean and readable as much as possible.
I added different sound effects with the 'secret person' image to the winning and losing pages. I played around with CSS to design the game the way I want to see it, but then I chosed to dive into more JS. I set a countdown timer that neither ends the game nor reset the page. :)
This week I learned
• to create and manipulate objects/arrays with the DOM
• to use different array methods
• how to structure my code in functions
• how to plan and think about game logic

If I had more time, I would put a guess counter and continue styling with my own images and layout.
