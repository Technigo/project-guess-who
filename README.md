# Project Name

This project is to create a digital version of the classic board game Guess who. 
 

## The problem

Practice creating objects and arrays and also connect this to the DOM. I tried to find a solution to style the alerts and I found SweetAlert. It was funny to figure out how to itegrate it in the project.

**What you need to do**

✓ The board with characters should be generated when the website is loaded.

✓ A randomly selected person should be set as the secret when the game starts.

✓ You should be able to select questions to ask about the people and filter the board based on those questions.

✓ You should also give the player feedback with alerts

✓ You should be able to guess the secret person and get an answer if it's correct or not.

If I had more time i would change all Characters, changing every object and filter them according to that. I would probably try to add some sounds
