# Guess Who Game

This is a web-based implementation of the classic Guess Who board game, where the player has to guess a secret person from a board with different characters. 
The project was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and includes the following features:

The board with characters is generated dynamically when the website is loaded.
A randomly selected person is set as the secret when the game starts.
You can select questions to ask about the people and filter the board based on those questions, by clicking on the corresponding buttons.
The player receives feedback with alerts, indicating whether the current selection of people matches the secret person, or if the game is over (i.e. the secret person was found or all the options were eliminated).
You can guess the secret person at any time, by clicking on the "Guess" button and entering the corresponding name in the input field. The game will display a message indicating whether the guess was correct or not, and if the game is over.

## The problem
Various resources and tools were utilized to approach the problem. Inspiration was sought from previous students' projects, which was a helpful starting point for understanding the project requirements and design. Additionally, Stackoverflow, various blogs, and ChatGPT were utilized. A more experienced coder helped with getting the filter method in place. 

If there had been more time, a counter would have been added for the number of player attempts, providing additional functionality and improving the user experience. There would also have been more focus on the CSS, such as adding animations to make the cards flip when hovering or clicking, and adding a footer to provide additional information and enhance the overall design.
