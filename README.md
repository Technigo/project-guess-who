# Guess Who Classic Game - Technigo week 5 - Objects,functions,lopps and arrays
This project is part of Technigo Remote Frontend Boot Camp. Focus is to create a piece of the classic board game Guess Who. When we started the project we got most of the styling and HTML structure as well as some functions. Since this is part of our boot camp we focused on the JavaScript part.

## The problem

To be able to build this site this game board I had to plan and think about the game logic. One important feature when building this game is of course to flter characters based on category (hair/eyes or accessories/others). In this game the player ask a question about a person, and then based on the answer to that question, filter out the people who match (or don't match) that answer.
