# Guess Who? Game Site

This project is built in order to learn the basics of Javascript. Arrays and object manipulation is the main focus of this project.

The game is based on the board game "Guess Who?". A secret character is randomly chosen by the `math.random()` and the player will eliminate characters by choosing qualities they think the secret character possesses. The question is answered either by yes (character retained) or no (character eliminated) until the characters are narrowed down to a few. The player can either choose directly or not.

## The problem

### Improvements in the future

The characters are going to be eliminated can have some animation before generating the new board.

The confirmatory alerts can be changed to a pop-up box with styling.
