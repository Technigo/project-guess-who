# Project Guess Who

This week's brief was to create a Guess Who game, focusing entirely on JavaScript.

## The problem

I found it very difficult to make this project work, but looking at other people's solutions on GitHub as well as speaking 
to people in my team really made the difference. It is very simple as of right now, but I am aiming to modify it later 
with my own images and characters, as well as new attributes, now that I know how everything works. I did begin to modify the CSS aswell, which I will continue to do to make it more my own.
