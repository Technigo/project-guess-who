# Project Name

This project is about building a digital version of the board game Guess Who using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The main focus is on the Javascript part. 

## The problem

I made use of DOM manipulation, event handling, function definitions, conditional statements, delayed execution, variable assignment, object and array manipulation.

I followed the instructions in the starter-code to make the game work and then added a few features: 
- Count of hints that the user receives every time the Find Out button is clicked
- A stopwatch to keep track of the game duration
- The possibility to ask for the player's name at the beginning and print it on the screen

Potential improvements can be:
- Changing the win or lose section so that when the player guesses wrong and if there are at least one person left to guess on, he/she is allowed to go back and make another guess. Adding a counter to keep track of the number of guesses a player makes.
- Adding sound/animation effects when turning the card and/or showing win or lose section
- Changing the stopwatch to a countdown timer to see if the player can find the right person within the time limit
