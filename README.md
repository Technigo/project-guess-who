# Project Guess Who

Make a guess who game. Based on the choosen question filter out the characters that has no atttribute that match the secret person.

## The problem

All the the different characters are stored as object in array, with different categories. Some of the categories have their own arrays. That was one of trickiest part to make the comparison when the category have multiple values. This was solved by using .includes(value). I use the filter method on the array to filter out the characters that does not match the secret person and the question asked. Got a lot of practice with declaring functions and when they should be invoked. Also when the different html sections should be displayed and not. If I had more time I would have tried to add a timer, have the player register with name and some sound effects.
