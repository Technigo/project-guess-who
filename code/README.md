# Project Name

This is my front end boot camp assignment number 4 creating creating a online version of the classic board game Guess Who? By using JavaScript, the main task was to create a functioning game for the user/player from start to finish. 

## The problem

For this assignment we were given some basic HTML and CCS, as well as a general set up structure for JavaScirpt. Starting from the top I worked my way through the necessities for the game - allocating the DOM selectors, analysing and using global variables and creating the required functions. The project was to a large extent about creating said functions, getting the game to execute the interactive actions accordingly.     

My plan was to solve the technical aspects of the project first, getting crucial functions up and running properly. Once that part was completed I dug my hands into the styling of the project - focusing on an 80s theme by using colors, fonts and sound effects typically originating from this period. I wanted for the aesthetics to have a quite silly and incredibly out dated look for being 2021, giving it a bit of a retro wink to the decade I was born. 

If I had more time I would make the page layout responsive to different screens. I would like for the "Play again" button to function, as well as adding a counter that keeps track of the amount of guesses the player makes. In terms of concept I would like to change all the board characters to eclectic 80s artists in the likes of Cyndi Lauper, Boy George, Bonnie Taylor, Elton John, Madonna, Adam Ant, Joan Jett, David Bowie etc. Since this was an era where a lot of people had extravagant hair, colorful make-up and crazy accessories I think it could generate in some fun feature selections in the hunt for the secret person!
