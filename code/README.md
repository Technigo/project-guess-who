# Project Name

This is my front end boot camp assignment number 4 creating creating a online version of the classic board game Guess Who? By using JavaScript, the main task was to create a functioning game for the user/player from start to finish. 

## The problem

For this assignment we were given some basic HTML and CCS, as well as a general set up structure for JavaScirpt. Starting from the top I worked my way through the nessecities for the game - allocating the DOM selectors, analysing and using global variables and creating the required functions. The projet was to a large extent about creating said functions, getting the game to execute the interactive actions accordingly.     

My plan was to solve the technical aspects of the project first, getting crucial functions up and running properly. Once that part was compleated I dug my hands into the styling of the project - focusing on an 80s theme by using colors, fonts and sound effects typically originiating from this period. I wanted for the aesthetics to have an incredibly silly and outdated look for being 2021, giving it a bit of a retro wink to the past. 

If I had more time I would make the "Play again" button to function. I would also change all the board characters to eclectic 80s artists in the likes of Cyndi Lauper, Boy George, Bonnie Taylor, Adam Ant, Joan Jett and David Bowie. Since this was an era where a lot of people had extravagant hair, colorful make-up and crazy accessories I think it could generate some fun feature selections in the hunt for the secret person!
